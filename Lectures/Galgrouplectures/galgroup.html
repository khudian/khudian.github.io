    Beginning from 2008 in our School it was organised 
lectures in different  topics of mathematics
 for undergraduate students. Thise lectures usually were 
delivered by our lecturers.  
   Some of these lectures which I did I put here on the web


</li><li><b>
<a href="euclocaltalk4.pdf"> Locally Euclidean Geometries and 
Lobachevsky geometry</a> (lecture on 22 November 2017)
 

<li><h3><a href="galoisgalois2.pdf">
Galois theory for pedestrians(Abstract and thesis of the talk.
 February 2016)</a></li>
We give here detailed abstract of the talk in ``Galois lectures''
which is planned on Wednesday
  2-nd March.  The content of the talk see in the etude below.
(February 2016)</h3>

<li><h3><a href="galped4.pdf">
Galois theory for pedestrians;  explicit formulae
for cubic and quartic equations  .
 25 March 2016)</a></li>
This etude is written on the base of the book of A.Khovansky 
`Galois Theory' and it is inspired by the lecture above
and by the discussion with R.Mkrtchyan of quantum mechanical interpretation
of roots of Lie algebra</h3>



  <li><h3><a href="hellycheb2w.pdf">Chebyshev approximation and Helly's Theorem
</a></li>
This is sketch of the lecture "Galois group" for students
 (see also the file "Chebyshev approx...." in subsection "Algebra" of 
Etudes)(26.11.13)</h3>


<li><h3><a href="argeomrv1.pdf"> The arithmetico-geometrical mean. What is it and why it is useful
(Galois group lecture on 26-th April 2012).</a></li></h3>
