    On the index of vector field.

    Thinking about Riemann-Horwitz formula I decided to do the following simple
    exercise:


   Consider the vector field
                $$
                A=(y-\b y^3)\p_x-x\p_y
                $$
and its image under the map   $z\to z^2\colon\,\,\, \CP\to \CP$.
The push-forward of the field $A$ is well defined under this map because
$A$ is invariant under transformation $z\to -z$. If $\b=0$ then the special points of the field
are just ramification points and sum of the indices preserves.
If $\beta\not=0$ then there are degenerate points $\pm 1/\b$. What is their contribution?
 I think thee calculations are useful, because they contain the part when one
 have to calculate an index in so called degenerate case (If vector field is equal zero and
 linear part is nothing but the sign of determinant of this linear operator)

  Second: Calculation of index will reveal the relation with Riemann-Hourwitz formula...


   So begin. The map  $z\to z^2$ is $u=x^2-y^2,v=2xy$. Its jacobian:
        $$
        \pmatrix
        {2x  &-2y\cr
         2y   &2x\cr
        }
    $$
        We see that
              $$
               \pmatrix
               {2x  &-2y\cr
         2y   &2x\cr
               }
         \pmatrix
        {y-\b y^3\cr
         -x\cr
        }
        =
         \pmatrix
        {4xy-2\b xy^3\cr
         2y^2-2x^2-2\b y^4 &2x
        }
              $$

The vector
                 $$
(y-\b y^3)\p_x-x\p_y\,\,\hbox{ at the point $(x,y)$}
                 $$
goes to the vector
               $$
               (4xy-2\b xy^3)\p_u-\left(2y^2-2x^2-2\b y^4\right)\p_y\,\,
               \hbox{ at the point $(u=x^2-y^2,v=2xy)$}
               $$
Pay attention on the fact that it is well defined: the transformation
$(x,y)\to (-x,-y)$ which does not change the point    $(u=x^2-y^2,v=2xy$
it does not change the vector too.

  {The index of initial vector field}

  The initial vector field is equal to zero in three points
  $(0,0)$, $(0,{1\over \sqrt \b})$ and $(0,-{1\over \sqrt \b})$
The indices of the initial vector in these points is equal
to $=1,-1,-1$ (It is just calculation of sign of determinant)
Now calculate the index at infinity. Perform coordinate transformation
corresponding to $z\to 1/z$:
                        $$
     x'={x\over x^2+y^2},y'=-{y\over x^2+y^2}\,,
     $$
     $$
       \pmatrix
        {x'_x  &x'_y\cr
         y'_x   &y'_y\cr
        }=
\pmatrix
        { {y^2-x^2\over (x^2+y^2)^2} &{-2xy\over (x^2+y^2)^2}\cr
          {2xy\over (x^2+y^2)^2}  &{y^2-x^2\over (x^2+y^2)^2}\cr
        },\quad
        \det
        \pmatrix
        {x'_x  &x'_y\cr
         y'_x   &y'_y\cr
        }={1\over (x^2+y^2)^2}
     $$
  We see that
          $$
                  \pmatrix
        {x'_x  &x'_y\cr
         y'_x   &y'_y\cr
        }
        \pmatrix
        {y-\b y^3\cr
         -x\cr
        }=
        {1\over \left({x^2+y^2}\right)^2}
\pmatrix
        { y^2-x^2 &-2xy\cr
          2xy  &y^2-x^2\cr
        }
        \pmatrix
        {y-\b y^3\cr
         -x\cr
        }=
          $$
          $$
        {1\over \left({x^2+y^2}\right)^2}
          \pmatrix
        { y(x^2+y^2)-\b y^3(y^2-x^2)\cr
        x(x^2+y^2)-2\b y^3\cdot xy  \cr
        }
             $$
          Thus
the vector
                 $$
(y-\b y^3)\p_x-x\p_y\,\,\hbox{ at the point $(x,y)$}
                 $$
goes to the vector
               $$
               \left[{y\over x^2+y^2}-\b y^3 {y^2-x^2\over (x^2+y^2)^2}\right]\p_{x'}+
               \left[{x\over x^2+y^2}-\b y^3 {2xy\over (x^2+y^2)^2}\right]\p_{y'}\,\,
               $$

           $$\hbox{ at the point $\,\,x'={x\over x^2+y^2},y'={y\over x^2+y^2})$}$$

It means that in coordinates $x',y'$  the vector field has appearance
                     $$
                     d
                     $$
        Here I stop. In the case $\b=0$ we see that sum of the indices is equal
        t0 $1+1=2$. I would like to show that index at infinity is equal to $3$.
        (because sum at the other points was equal to $1+(-1)+(-1)=-1$)
        but our field is not equal to zero at infinity. 
\bye
