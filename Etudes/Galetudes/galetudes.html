           <h1>Galois Etudes</h1>
<br>

<li><h3><a href="galchildr1.pdf"> Galois Theory  and elementary mathematics I.
(March 2005)</a></li></h3>


<li><h3><a href="angles2.pdf"> Galois Theory and elementary mathematics II.
(March 2005)</a></li></h3>



<li><h3><a href="lagrange1.pdf">Lagrange Theorem.</a></li>
We discuss "well-forgotten" Lagrange Theorem which is an ancestor of Galois 
Theory.(February 2008)</h3>


<li><h3><a href="galoisgalois2.pdf">
Galois theory for pedestrians(Abstract and thesis of the talk.
 February 2016)</a></li>
We give here detailed abstract of the talk in ``Galois lectures''
which is planned on Wednesday
  2-nd March.  The content of the talk see in the etude below.
(February 2016)</h3>

<li><h3><a href="galped4.pdf">
Galois theory for pedestrians;  explicit formulae
for cubic and quartic equations  .
 25 March 2016)</a></li>
This etude is written on the base of the book of A.Khovansky 
`Galois Theory' and it is inspired by the lecture above
and by the discussion with R.Mkrtchyan of quantum mechanical interpretation
of roots of Lie algebra</h3>
