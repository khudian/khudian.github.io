<li><h3><a href="jacidentandheights2.pdf">Jacoby identity and intersection of heights of the triangle.</a></li>
We show that the fact that three heights of triangle intersect at the one point
follows from the Jacoby identity for cross-product.</h3>

We study shape operator for surface of codimension 1 in Euclidean space and show
why for even-dimensional surface Gaussian curvature is invariant of isometries.</h3>

seminar)</h3>







<li><h3><a href="projectiv1.pdf">Projective transformations:
pedestrian's point of view</a></li>
We try to answer on the question: why an arbitrary transformation which transforms straight lines to straight lines are projective trasnformations. Our considerations
are elementary.</h3>


<li><h3><a href="equipartial2.pdf">Cube and tetrahedron are not equipartial</a></li>
It is elementary geometrical fact that two polygons of equal area are equipartial.
It is deep result of XX-th centure mathematics that cube and tetrahedron of equal 
volumes are not equipartial (Hilbert's problem).  In other words one does not need 
Calculus to find the volume of triangle and one does need Calculus to find the volume of 
tetrahedron (22.04.09). (I corrected erratum and added 
Remark on 28.12.13)</h3>

<li><h3><a href="dhl4.pdf">Duistermaat-Heckman 
localisation formula II </a></li>
 It is very natural to formulate
Duistermaat-Heckman localisation formula in the language of
"supermathematics". We discuss here this formulation 
and give an idea of proof of Duistermaat-Heckman formula
in this approach. This text is the continuation of the previous etude.

   <li><h3><a href="conics2.pdf">On one property of conics
</a></li>
If $C$ is a circle then the set of points which are verticis 
of circular cone over $C$ is a 
line passing through the centre of this circle. How looks this locus
in the case if $C$ is just an arbitrary quadric on the plane?
  In this etude I try to asnwer this question 
which I heard from Gabor Megyesi (Autumn 14).</h3>

   Comment (Spring 2017):  In the file above doing hard calculations 
three years ago I came to very beautiful answer: 
Let $C$ be an ellipse (hyperbola)
with foci at the points $F_1,F_2$. Then take the plane orthogonal 
to the curve $C$ which passes through the foci. Consider cofocal 
hyperbola (ellipse)
   $C^*$ in this plane, i.e. the hyperbola (ellispe) 
which passes via foci $F_1,F_2$ and has foci
at the points $F_1^*,F_2^*$ which are intersection of $F_1F_2$
with intial curve $C$.   Answer is very beautiful.
    Just two days ago  I found very short and elegant explanation of
 this fact, using Dandelen spheres: If a point $K$ belongs to the locus
then consider  triangle $KF_1^*F_2^*$ and the Dandelen circle
 in this triangle which touches the edge $F_1^*F_2^*$ at the point
   $F_1$, we see that difference of the sides $KF_1^*$
  and $KF_2^*$ is exactly equal to the difference of
the segments $F_1^*F_1$ and $F_1F_2^*$. Thus $K$ belongs to this hyperbola
(we suppose that $C$ is ellipse.)
   THis is really short and beautiful.
