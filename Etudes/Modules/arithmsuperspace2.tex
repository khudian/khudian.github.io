           {Arithmetic superspace}

  First of all recall the notion of usual superspace:

    Real $p|q$-dimensional superspace is a functor from category of
    Grassman algebras to the category of the sets
To an arbitrary Grassmann algebra $\L$ one can assign
a set $\R_\L$ of
$\{(a_1,\dots,a_p,\a_1,\dots,\a_q)\}$
where $a_i$ are even and $\a_j$ are odd elements of the algebra $\L$.

 It is instructive to recall what is a function on superspace.

 The rigid definition is that we have to define it on every space $\R_\Lambda$
 and put the condition that corresponding diagrammes be commutative, i.e.

   \centerline {function on superspace is a canonical transformation of functors}


 Intuitivey we want to give a general rule such that it has manifestations for every Grassman
 algebra. E.g. function $f=x_1+\theta\sin x_2$ on $2|1$-dimensional superspace  $\R^{2|1}$
 can be viewed as a function $f(a_1,a_2,\a_1)=a_1+\a_1$
