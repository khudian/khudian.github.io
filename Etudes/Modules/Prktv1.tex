\def\L{\Lambda}
  Consider the following example.

  Let $f_a$ $a=1,\dots,n$ be a set of functions on $(0,1)$
  and let

  1) $\L$ be an algebra of smooth functions on $R$

  2) $\L_0$ an algebra of smooth functions $f$ such that $supp\,\, f\subseteq [0,1]$


  Consider a module $P$ ($P_0$) generated by $f_a$ with
  coefficients
  in $\L$ ($\L_0$)

  Then $P$ and $P_0$ are projective modules and $P$ is free.

  Sophisticated explanation why $P$ is free is following:
  $P$ ($P_0$) corresponds to module of global sections of fibre bundle
  that is subbundle of trivial fibre bundle $[0,1]\times R^n$
  ($S^1\times R^n$). All bundles over discs are trivial.



  It is really funny exercise to construct embedding
  $\iota$ of module $P$ ($P_0$) in free module $E^n$
  with generators $\{e_a\}$ such that this embedding
  splits module $E^n$ on projective modules:
                 $$
      \iota P\sum \ker\Pi=E
                   $$
     where $\Pi f_a=e_a$

  In general case projective module $P_0$ is not free.

    For example if $f_a$ ($a=1,2$) are two functions
    such that $f_a(0)+f_a(1)=0$ and these functions
    are independent (e.g. $f_1=\cos \pi x$ $f_2=\sin \pi x$)
    then $P_0$ is projective not free module of global
    sections of Mobius strip.
