We discuss the famous theorem which explains where from the signature definition comes,(around 2007)</h3>




<li><h3><a href="nullstelensatz1.pdf">On a simple proof of Nullstelensatz.</a></li>
We retell here in detail the simple "folklore" proof of
of Nullstelensatz. (04.08.09)</h3>



<li><h3><a href="twodeterminants1.pdf"> Three identities for determinants.</a></li>
We consider here two simple but beautiful formuale for determinants... (28.08.09)</h3>

We explain how Bernoulli numbers appear from basic formulae of calculus... (20.09.09)</h3>



<li><h3><a href="crammer2.pdf"> Geometrical meaning of Crammer rule</a></li>
Crammer rule seems to be annoying. But rightly viewed it is so beautiful... We expose here a
simple and beautiful identity which implies Crammer rule.  (12.10.11)</h3>

<li><h3><a href="pwrsofnmber2.pdf"> Irrational powers of integers</a></li>
  Here I expose proof of some fact.  This proof is much more close to me than a problem itself.
(may be because n-homomorphisms?...)  (19.02.12)</h3>


 <li><h3><a href="funnyintegrals1.pdf"> 
  Borwein integrals</a></li>
  Here I expose a funny sequence of integrals which I learnt yesterday...  (11.04.12)</h3>

 <li><h3><a href="chebysh2.pdf"> 
  Chebyshev approximation and Helly's Theorem</a></li>
  Here I discuss one application of Helly's Theorem on 
convex bodies to a problem of approximating continous functions by
polynomials(10.11.13)</h3>

 <li><h3><a href="barnesexp1.pdf"> 
  Barnes functions and integrals</a></li>
  We calculate so called  incomplete Gamma function
and related integrals using 
analytical continuation which was used for Barnes functions.
  The content is essentially overlapped with older
etude ``On calculating of integral...''(28.12.15)</h3>

 <li><h3><a href="onedeterminant2.pdf"> 
  On  calculation of one determinant</a></li>
   I hesitated to put this elementary calculation,
but on other hand this is very beautiful: to calculate
  something polynomial we consider limit. Does this happen
   often?   (18.01.17)</h3>

 <li><h3><a href="groupformul1.pdf"> 
  On  brute force combinatorial calculations in Lie groups
</a></li>
   I put here calculations of exponents in Lie group.
They appear elsewhere, and they are related with
Campbell-Haussdorff...(18.01.18)</h3>

 <li><h3><a href="linalgcomb4.pdf"> 
  On  one problem of linear algebra
</a></li>
The problem was suggested to me by my son David, and by my knowledge
he heard it from Vladimir Dotzenko.
 I present first my solution of this problem.  
It  is founded on one combinatorial fact
which was considered in one of my  etudes (see the etude
"The number of permutations..."  in the subsection 
"Arithmetics" on 18.11.18)  and on the concept of even and odd numbers.
   Then I present the solution of James Montaldi (see the first Appendix in
my text). The solution of James gives the clear understanding 
of the role of the  finite field  $Z/2Z$. 
My old friend, Sasha Karabegov, mathematician and the 
 "old olimpiadnik" suggested another solution which reveals the fact that
the roots of the question are in $2$-adic numbers.
Here is the <a href="linalgcombkarabeg2.pdf"> 
Solution of Sasha Karabegov</a>.</h3>

  Finally I present the 
version of the question suggested by Sasha Borovik,
<a href="linalgbor1.pdf"> 
Solution of Sasha Borovik</a>,</h3>.
This version is accessible for school pupils, 
and it convinces
the importance of $2$-adic on the elementary level.


 <li><h3><a href="taylor4.pdf"> 
  On  Taylor Theorem
</a></li>
I tell here the short story about effectiveness of one indentity
to prove the Taylor Theorem and how it was used in the 
beautiful statement proved by my friend 
Sasha Karabegov in PUTNAM competition
