<li><h3><a href="quadrform2.pdf"> On relation between 
quadratic and bilinear forms I
</a></li>(around 2005)</h3>


<li><h3><a href="seeley1.pdf"> 
On calculating of integral.... </a></li>(around 2006)</h3>



<li><h3><a href="silvstr1.pdf">On number of real roots 
(Silvester Theorem). </a></li>
We discuss the famous theorem which explains where from the signature definition comes,(around 2007)</h3>




<li><h3><a href="nullstelensatz1.pdf">On a simple proof of Nullstelensaz.</a></li>
We retell here in detail the simple "folklore" proof of
of Nullstelensatz. (04.08.09)</h3>



<li><h3><a href="twodeterminants1.pdf"> Three identities for determinants.</a></li>
We consider here two simple but beautiful formuale for determinants... (28.08.09)</h3>




<li><h3><a href="bernoul1.pdf"> Bernoulli numbers, Bernoulli polynomials....</a></li>
We explain how Bernoulli numbers appear from basic formulae of calculus... (20.09.09)</h3>



<li><h3><a href="crammer2.pdf"> Geometrical meaning of Crammer rule</a></li>
Crammer rule seems to be annoying. But rightly viewed it is so beautiful... We expose here a
simple and beautiful identity which implies Crammer rule.  (12.10.11)</h3>

<li><h3><a href="pwrsofnmber2.pdf"> Irrational powers of integers</a></li>
  Here I expose proof of some fact.  This proof is much more close to me than a problem itself.
(may be because n-homomorphisms?...)  (19.02.12)</h3>


 <li><h3><a href="funnyintegrals1.pdf"> 
  Borwein integrals</a></li>
  Here I expose a funny sequence of integrals which I learnt yesterday...  (11.04.12)</h3>

 <li><h3><a href="chebysh2.pdf"> 
  Chebyshev approximation and Helly's Theorem</a></li>
  Here I discuss one application of Helly's Theorem on 
convex bodies to a problem of approximating continous functions by
polynomials(10.11.13)</h3>

 <li><h3><a href="barnesexp1.pdf"> 
  Barnes functions and integrals</a></li>
  We calculate so called  incomplete Gamma function
and related integrals using 
analytical continuation which was used for Barnes functions.
  The content is essentially overlapped with older
etude ``On calculating of integral...''(28.12.15)</h3>

 <li><h3><a href="onedeterminant2.pdf"> 
  On  calculation of one determinant</a></li>
   I hesitated to put this elementary calculation,
but on other hand this is very beautiful: to calculate
  something polynomial we consider limit. Does this happen
   often?   (18.01.17)</h3>

 <li><h3><a href="groupformul1.pdf"> 
  On  brute force combinatorial calculations in Lie groups
</a></li>
   I put here calculations of exponents in Lie group.
They appear elsewhere, and they are related with
Campbell-Haussdorff...(18.01.18)</h3>
