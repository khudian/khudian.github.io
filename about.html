<b>
I am <a href="...">Armenian</a>, Soviet mathematician.
 (After 1990, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenia">
 Armenia </a>one of republics of USSR became independent state.)
I work in Manchester, United Kingdom since 2000.
I was born in 1955 in Yerevan (capital of Armenia), where I spent all my life, until 1996, except 7 years of graduate and postgraduate study in Moscow.

<p> I finished secondary school in 1972 and became an undergraduate student
 of the Department of Physics of Yerevan State University.
From 1975 I continued my studies in the Special Faculty of Physics of Moscow Physical Engineering Institute (University). I graduated from it in 1978 and the next 3 years I was
 PhD student of the Department of Theoretical Physics of this Institute.
 My teacher in mathematics is professor
<a href="http://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~schwarz/">Albert Solomonovitch Schwarz</a>.
   I defended my PhD thesis in 1982.


<p> From 1981 I worked in Laboratory of Theoretical Physics of Yerevan Physics Institute
 and from 1984 I worked in the Department of Theoretical Physics of Yerevan State University.
In  1996 I moved with my family to Russia to work in JINR 
(Joint Institute of Nuclear research, Dubna). In February 2000 I came to
Manchester, Department of Mathematics in UMIST.
