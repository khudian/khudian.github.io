\centerline {\bf On one triple}
<br>
Let $M$ be a (super)manifold, 
and $\M=C^\infty(M)$
be an algebra of functions on this manifold.
Consider the triple  (1):
       $$
\hbox{Poisson bracket 
on $C^\infty(M)$}\rightarrow
\hbox{Homotopy Poisson bracket 
on $C^\infty(M)$}\rightarrow
\hbox{Vector field  
on $C^\infty(M)$}
       $$ 
{\it Where it comes from?:}
<br>
Let $H$ be an arbitrary even Hamiltonian
on $\Pi T^*M$ (arbitrary odd Hamiltonian 
on $T^*M$). It defines homotopy even 
Poisson bracket on $M$, the series of bracets:
for every $n$
         $$
\{f_1,\dots,f_n\}=
[\dots[H,f_1],f_2]\dots, f_n]\big\vert_{M}\,,
   \tag{2a}
        $$
where  $[\,,,\,,]$ is canonical odd Poisson bracket
on $\Pi T^*M$.
(Respectively in the case if $H$
is an odd Hamiltonian on $T^*M$
we come to homotopy odd Poisson bracket
         $$
\{f_1,\dots,f_n\}=
(\dots(H,f_1),f_2)\dots, f_n)_{M}\,,
\tag{2b}
        $$
where  $(\,,,\,,)$ is canonical even
 Poisson bracket on $\Pi T^*M$.)
<br>
The Jacobi identity for the series of
homotopy even Poisson brackets 
(2a) is provided with master-equation
       $$
      [H,H]=0
        \tag{3a}
       $$
(Respectively the Jacobi identity for 
the series of
homotopy odd Poisson brackets 
(2b) is provided with master-equation
       $$
      (H,H)=0
        \tag{3b}
       $$)
If Hamiltonian $H$ is quadratic in fibers,
then 
we come to usual Poisson bracket. If $H$
is an arbitrary function we come to 
     homotopy Poisson bracket, and
if $H$ is the linear over fibers we come to
vector field.
<br>
We see that usual Poisson bracket and vector field
are related with each other being the special
cases of homotopy Poisson bracket.
All three structures are represented
by homological vector field on
infinite-dimensional
manifold $\M=C^\infty(M)$
<br>
$$
f\mapsto f+
\tau 
H\left (
x, {\p f\over \p x}\right)\,,
Q=\int dx 
H\left(x,{\delta f\over \delta x}\right)
{\delta\over \delta x}
   \tag{4}
      $$
 In the case of linear Hamiltonian
vector field (4) is just the image of 
vector field
  generated by the linear Hamiltonian:
       $$
x^i\mapsto x^i+\tau K^i\longrightarrow
f\mapsto f(x^i+\tau K^i)
         $$
<br>

<br>
{\tt I cannot avoid the temptation to compare this triple
whith another triple:
<br>
Many years ago I learned from the book of 
Polia about the triple
       $$
 \hbox{square}\rightarrow 
\hbox{polygon}\rightarrow \hbox{trianlge}
       $$
it can be used for the very elegant proof of Pythagorean Theorem:
<br>
   Let  $\triangle ACB$ be rectangular triangle,
 $\angle C={\pi\over 2}$. 
We denote $a=|BC|,b=|AC|,c=|AB|$
<br>
Consider the  following  three statements
<br>
\medskip
<br>
I.  Let
$\alpha_4,\beta_4,\gamma_4$
be three squares such that
the square $\alpha_4$ is the square on the 
side $BC$, i.e.
its side is equal to $a$,
the square $\beta_4$ is the square on the 
side $AC$, i.e.
its side is equal to $b$,
and the square $\gamma_4$ is the square on the side $AB$, 
i.e. its side is equal to $c$,
then        $$
      a^2+b^2=c^2\,,\qquad \hbox{Pythagorean Theorem}
        $$
which is nothing but the statement
        $$
\hbox{Area of the square $\alpha_4$}+
\hbox{Area of the square $\beta_4$}
=\hbox{Area of the square $\gamma_4$}
                    \tag{*}
        $$
<br>
\medskip
<br>
II.  Consider three similar n-gones,
(polygones with $n$ sides),
$\alpha_n,\beta_n,\gamma_n$,
such that
one of the sights of
polygon  $\alpha_n$ is equal to $a$,
the corresponding side of the similar 
polygon  $\beta_n$ is equal to $b$
and
the corresponding side of the similar 
polygon  $\gamma_n$ is equal to $c$.
<br>
Then 
        $$
\hbox{Area of the polygon $\alpha_n$}+
\hbox{Area of the polygon $\beta_n$}
=\hbox{Area of the polygon$\gamma_n$}
                    \tag{**}
        $$
<br>
\medskip
<br>
III.   Consider three similar
rectangular $\alpha_3$,
$\beta_3$ and $\gamma_3$,
        $
\triangle\alpha_3\sim\triangle \beta_3
\sim\triangle \gamma_3$
such that  
hypothenuse of the triangle
  $\a_3$ is equal to $a$, 
hypothenuse of the triangle
  $\beta_3$ is equal to $b$, and 
hypothenuse of the triangle
  $\gamma_3$ is equal to $c$
then
             $$
\hbox{Area of   $\triangle\alpha_3$}+
\hbox{Area of $\triangle\beta_n$}
=\hbox{Area of $\triangle\gamma_3$}\tag{***}
             $$ 
<br>
The statements I, II and III are equivalent.
since
Area of every polygon is proportional to
the square of the side.
This means that prove the Pythagoeran Teorem
it suffices to prove just one of these statements.
Prove the statement (***).
<br>
  Let $CD$ be the height of the triangle $ACB$,
 $CD\perp AB$ and $D\in AB$.
<br>
Triangles $ACD$ and $BCD$
are rectangular triangles, 
they are similar to the triangle $ABC$.
Hypothenuse of triangle $ACD$ is equal to $a$
hypothenuse of triangle $BCD$ is equal to $b$
Hypothenuse of triangle $ACB$ is equal to $c$.
We have that
    $$
{\rm Area}(\triangle ACD)
+{\rm Area}(\triangle BCD)=
{\rm Area}(\triangle ACB)
    $$ 
This proves (***). This proves Pythagorean Theorem.
<br>
To prove this theorem we first generalise the 
statement from suqre to arbitrary polygon, then
specify the special type of polygon---
rectangular triangle.
