<h3> On two ways </h3>
<br>
Reading AKSZ paper I realised that the
chidlish version of BRST----BV relation is the following:
          $$
     \matrix
        {
    \hbox{homological vector field $\X$ on $M$, $[\X,\X]=0$}\cr
   \hbox{if $P$ is Poisson and $\X$ has Hamiltonian $Q$}\cr 
    \{Q,f\}=\X f, Q \,\hbox{BRST charge}\cr 
     \hbox{ BRST equation  $\{Q,Q\}=0$}\cr
      }
  \Rightarrow
      \matrix
        {
    \hbox{linear Hamiltonian  $S=X^ax^*_a$ on $\Pi T^*M$}\cr
   \hbox{for function $f$ on $M$}\cr 
          [S,f]=\{Q,f\}   \cr 
     \hbox{ BV equation  $[S,S]=0$}\cr
    }
          $$
<br>
(One can consider instead BV linear even action $S$ on $\Pi T^*M$
the linear odd action $S^{\rm odd}= X^a(x)p_a$
in the space $T^*M$ respectively with 
bracket $(\_,\_)$ on $T^*M$ and master equation $(S,S)=0$)
<br>
\medskip
<br>
Meaning of the equation above is the following:
An action of  homological vector  field $\X$
on arbitrary function $f$ on $M$ is equal to 
canoncial Schouten  bracket on $\Pi T^*M$ of even linear 
Hamiltonian  $S^{\rm odd}=X^a(x)x_a^*$ (master-action)
defined on $\Pi T^*M$ with this function $f$,
or alternaticely it is equatl to  
canonical Poisson bracket in $T^*M$ of odd linear Hamiltonian
  $S^{\rm odd}=X^a(x)p_a^*$ 
defined on $T^*M$ with this function $f$:
           $$
\X f=[X^a(x)x_a^*,f(x)]=\left(X^a(x)p_a,f(x)\right)
\tag{1}
           $$
<br>
On the other hand this can be represented as
a derived bracket.
Equation above means that 
the action of vector field $\X$ on function
$f$ can be considered as homotopy
Schouten bracket (with Hamiltonian $X^a(x)x_a^*$)
or it can be considered as homotopy
Poisson bracket (with Hamiltonian $X^a(x)p_a$).
  What choice is better?
   Suppose that the  field $\X$ 
is Hamitonian.
Let $P=P(x,x^*)$  be an
even function which  generates  Poisson bracket $\{\_,\_\}$:
              ($P=\{x^a,x^b\}x_a^*x_b^*$):
         $$
\{f,g\}=\{f,g\}_P=[[P,f],g]\,,
          $$
and let $Q_\X$ 
be Hamiltonian of $\X$. Then
          $$
\X f=\{Q_\X,f\}_P=[[P,Q_\X],f]
          $$
i.e. Hamiltonian which generates action of vector field
$[P,Q_\X]$ and it is homotopy Schouten bracket.
<br>
 This quesiont arises when we consider two little bit different
scemes of construction higher Koszul bracket.
In the first approach (paper 2008)
we considered linear Hamiltonian  $H=\left(d_P\right)^a p_a$
for Lichnerowicz differential $d_P$ on $\Pi T^*M$
(Then applying MX symplectomorphsim to this Hamiltonian
 we came to the new Hamiltonian which produces
higher Koszul bracket via derived.)
<br>
In the new approach we consider Lichnerowicz differential 
$d_P$ on $\Pi T^*M$ as homotopy Schouten bracket
generated by Hamiltonian $H$ and this is the same linear
Hamiltonian as before.
