   {\bf Conformal map and
in terms of Green function}

  This is the topic why I began to read the Lavrentiev inspired
by French book. Now it is alright.
   If we know the Green function $G_U(z_0,z)$  
 then it defines in  $U\backslash \{z_0\}$ holomorphic function
$\hat G=G+iU$ where $U$ 
is defined up to period  $\Pi=\oint...$

Thus we come to  the map $e^{...G\over \Pi}$.

\m

  (comment ca marche: the question of bijection????)

\m

  {\bf Example}  How to construct $\H\to D$
We know that
             $$
  G_\H=...\left(\log|z-z_0|-\log|z-\bar z_0|\right)
             $$
(coefficient $-{1\over 2\pi}$)

  Hence  $G(z_0,z)=\approx {z-z_0\over z-\bar z_0}$

is it unique? Yes up to the coefficient $e^{i\varphi}$. 

 In  the blog on 7 August
we considered function
       $$
    {G(z_0,z)-G(z_0,\zeta)\over 1-\bar{G(z_0.\zeta)} 
G(z_0,z)}
       $$
Thus we see that this function is equal to
      $z-\zeta\over z-\bar\zeta$ up to a coefficient.

{\bf Remark} {\it We used here that every $F$ holomorphic map
of Disc $|z|<1$ onto itself such that $F(\zeta)=0$ 
is nothing but
${z-\zeta\over 1-\bar\zeta z}e^{i\varphi}$ }


\bye
