<h3> One fact from linear algbera of Lagrangian surfaces</h3>
Today is 85 years to Albert Solomonovitch Schwarz...
<br>

<br>
Let $V$ be finite-dimensional symplectic vector space,
i.e. $V$ is equipped with non-degenerate antisymmetric
bilinear form $\langle u,v\rangle= \w (u,v)$:
           $$
\langle u,v\rangle
=-\langle v,u\rangle\,,\quad
\langle \x, V\rangle=0\Rightarrow \x=0\,.
       \tag{1a}
           $$
<br>
Let $X$ be a Lagrangian plane  in finite-dimensional
symplectiv vector space $V$, i.e. scalar product
vanishes on $X$   
    $$
\hbox {for arbitrary $\x,\x'$ in $X$ }\quad
\langle \x,\x'\rangle=0\,,
       \tag{1b} 
      $$
and this cannot be enlarged, i.e.
an  arbitrary vector $\y$
which is orthogonal to $X$ belongs to $X$:
      $$ 
\hbox{ if $\langle \y,\x \rangle=0$ 
  for every $\x\in X$ then}\,\,
     y\in X\,. 
\tag{1c}      
     $$
In particular this means that Lagrangian plane
is half-dimensional in symplectic vector space:
 $\dim X={\dim V\over 2}=n$.
<br>

<br>
We want to study Lagrangian planes which are transversal
to $X$.  Denote a space of such Lagrangian planes
$\L_X$:
        $$
\L_X=\{Y\colon \,\,\hbox {$Y$ is Lagrangian plane in $V$
and}\,\, X\cap Y=0\}\,.
    \tag{2a}
        $$
<br>
<b> Theorem</b>
<i> 
<br>
i) The set $\L_X$ of Lagrangian planes which are transversal to 
Lagrangian plane $X$, $X$
is in one-one correspondence with a set of ,
linear operators $P$ on $V$,  such that
     $$
(Pu,v)+(u,PV)=(u,v)\,,
    \tag{3a}
     $$
and
       $$
  {\rm ker\,}P=X\,.
     \tag{3b}
       $$
Namely every Lagrangian plane $Y$  which is transversal to
the plane $X$ defines the following operator $P=P_Y$:
                    $$
 \forall u\in V\,,\quad   P_Y (u)=P_Y(\x+\y)=\y\,,
                       \tag{4a}
                    $$
where $u=\x+\y$ is expansion of  a vector  over 
transversal Lagrangian
planes $X$ and $Y$, $\x\in X$, $\y\in Y$. 
Operator $P=P_Y$ in (4a)  evidently 
obeys conditions (3a) and (3b).
<br>
 Conversely
 every operator $P$  which obeys equations (3a) and (3b)
defines Lagrangian plane
             $$
  Y=Y_P=\Im P\,,
        \tag{4b}
             $$
<br>
  which is transversal to plane $X$.
<br>
The correspondence 
<br>
$$
\hbox {Transversal Lagrangian
planes}\leftrightarrow \hbox {linear operator $P$
obeying (3a) and (3b)}$$
is reciprocal:
     $$
  P_{Y_P}=P\,,  Y_{P_Y}=Y\,.
        $$
<br>
ii) The set of ${\cal L}_X$ of Lagrangian planes which is
transversal
to the plane given Lagrangian plane  $X$  is  an affine
space which is  associated with the 
 vector space of symmetric 
bilinear forms on the factor space 
$V\backslash X$.  In particular
   $$
{\rm dim\,}\L_X={n{n+1}\over 2}\,,\quad ({\rm dim
\,}V=2n)\,.
  \tag{3c}
   $$
<br>

<br>

<br>
<b> Remark</b>  Note that for Lagrangian plane $X$ condition (3b)  
may be weaken (is
equivalent) to
condition  $P\big\vert X=0$, i.e. $X\subseteq \ker P$.
<br>
  Indeed suppose that $X$ is Lagrangian and operator $P$
vanishes on $X$. Show that this implies that $X=\ker P$.
  Let $\y$ be a vector such that $\y \in \ker P$, 
then we have that for every 
 $\x\in X$  
      $$
\langle P(\y),\x\rangle
+
\langle \y,P(\x)\rangle=
\langle \y,\x\rangle\not=0\Rightarrow 
\hbox {hence due to (1c) $\y\in X$}\,.
\tag{5}
      $$
This proves that $X=\ker P$.
<br>
Now prove (4b),  that $Y=\Im P$  
is Lagrangian plane transversal to $X$
if conditions (3a,3b) are obeyed.
<br>
It follows from the following statement.
         $$
\ker P=\Im (P-I)\,.
    \tag{6}
         $$

<br>
Indeed condition $X=\ker P$ in (3b) implies that
  $\dim \Im P=n$.  we have that $\dim \ker P=\dim (P-I)=n$
also.   According equation (6) 
 planes $\Im P$ and $\Im (P-I)=\ker P$ intersect by zero
vector.  Hence we see that planes $\ker P=X$
and $\Im P=Y$ are transversal. Thus $Y$ is transversal
to $X$. It remains to prove that every two vectors in
$Y=\Im P$
are orthogonal to each other:
           $$
\langle\y,\y'\rangle
=\langle P\y,\y'\rangle
\langle\y,P\y'\rangle=
2\langle\y,\y'\rangle\Rightarrow \langle
\y,\y'\rangle=0\,.
           $$ 
It remains to prove equation (6)
Sure it can be proved using results of
previous blog on 22-nd June,<div class="footnote-head"></div>
<div class="footnote-body">Note that in the case if only
condition (3a) is obeyed, then operator
$A=P-{1\over 2}I$ belongs to $sp(2)$
and we come to the fact that 
        $$
  \ker P=\left(\Im\left(P-I\right)\right)^\perp
        $$
 (see blog on 22-nd June of this month.)</div>
however do it independently:
For every $\x\ker P=X$,
      $$
\x=P(-\x)-I(-\x)\,,
      $$
hence $\ker P\subseteq \Im (P-I)$. Now prove 
the converse implication. Let $\y=Pu-u\in \Im (P_I)$,
then due to (3a) for an arbitrary $\x\in X$ we have that
          $$
\langle\y,\x\rangle
      =     
\langle Pu-u,\x\rangle
      =     
\langle u,P(\x)\rangle
      =0\Rightarrow \y\in X=\ker P     
         $$
Thus we proved that $Y=\Im P$ is Lagrangian plane
transversal to the Lagrangian plane $X$.
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Now prove the second part of Theorem.
<br>
Operator $P$ obeying conditions (3a)  can be codified
  by symmetric bilinear form
         $$
Q(u,v)=\langle P(u),v\rangle-{1\over 2}\langle u,v\rangle
         $$
Condition (3b) means that this form vanishes for $u\in
X$.  If we choose an arbitrary `point' in $\L_X$ a
Lagrangian
plane $\Y$ then we come to:
        $$
\hbox {for $u=\x+\y$, $v=\x'+\y'$}\,,\,
  Q(\x,\x')=0\,, Q(\x,\y')={1\over 2}\langle\y',\x\rangle\,,
  Q(\y,\x')={1\over 2}\langle \y,\x'\rangle\,,
    $$ 
where $\x+\y$ is an expansion over planes $X,Y$.
Thus we see that operator $P$ obeying to equations 
(3a) and (3b) is codified by bilinear form on $Y$.
<br>
<b> Example</b>  Consider $V=T^*{\bf R}^n$
with basis $\p_i,\p^j$:
        $$
\p_i={\p\over \p q^i}\,,
\p^j={\p\over \p p_j}\,, i,j=1,\dots,n\,.
        $$
and with scalar product
  $$
\langle\p^i,\p^j=0\rangle\,,
\langle\p^i,\p_j=\delta^i_j\rangle\,,
\langle\p_i,\p^j=-\delta_i^j\rangle\,,
\langle\p_i,\p_j=-0\rangle\,.
  $$
and consider $X$ is Lagrangian plane spanned by $\{\p_i\}$
(coordinates), and transversal plane $Y$ spanned by 
vectors $\{\p^j\}$.
Any symmetric bilinear form $Q^{mn}$  codifies operator
   $P$ such that
      $$
P(\p_i)=0\,,  P(\p^k)=\p^k+Q^{km}\p_m
       $$ 
<br>
Let $Q_{mn}$ be
