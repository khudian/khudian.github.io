   <h3> Geometry of diff.equations and Monge cone</h3>

<br>
Consider $2n+1$-dimension space $J^1(M)$  of first jets of
$n$-dimensional manifold $M$.
Let  
    $$
\EE\colon\quad F(u,p_i,q^j)=0
    $$
be hypersurface in $J^1(M)$, the differential equation.
<br>
Suppose that points of $\EE$ are regular.
<br>

<br>
<b> DEFINITION</b>
   A point $\pb\in\EE$ is called <i> non- characteristic</i>
if tangent hyperplane $T_\pb M$ and
 the <i> contact hyperplane</i> $\CC_\pb$  
(contact hyperplane consists of vectors
which are vanished by 
the contact $1$-form $\w=p_idq^i-du$)
are transversal to each other, i.e. tangent vectors
to $\EE$ at the point $\pb$ and vectors in contact plane
span all the tangent space:
            $$
     T_\pb \EE\oplus \CC_\pb=T_\pb (J^1(M))
            \Leftrightarrow
\dim \CC_\pb\cap T_\pb\EE=2n-1\,.
        $$
and  this is  is equivalent to the condition
that contact form $\w$ and the form $dF$ are not collinear
at the point $\pb$ \footnote{$^*$}{One can easy to check this choosing
covectors $\w$ and $dF$ as elemnets of basis.}.
<br>

<br>
<b> DEFINITION</b>
The intersection of contact and  tangent planes is
called <i> characteristic plane.</i> 
<br>

<br>
We denote  characteristic plane by $\CC(\EE)_\pb$
<br>
The form $dp_1\wedge dq^1+\dots+dp_n\wedge dq^n$  
is non-degenerate on contact hyperplane $\CC_\pb$, and
on $2n-1$-dimensional plane $\Pi_\pb\subset \CC_\pb$.
It  defines the  characteristic direction, the direction that
is symplectoorthogonal  to all the vectors of the plane $\Pi_\pb$.
<br>
     One can see that this direction can be defined by the
infinitesimal contact symmetry:
     $$
\X_F=
{\p F\over \p p^i}{\p\over \p q^i}
            -
{\p F\over \p q_i}{\p\over \p p_i}
              -
p_i{\p F\over \p u}{\p\over \p p_i}
              +
p_i{\p F\over \p p_i}{\p\over \p u}
              -
F{\p\over \p u}
      $$
<br>
The contact distribution $\CC$,  (the distribution of contact planes)
defines 
<br>
Now return to differential equation defined
by non-charateristic hypersurface $\EE$.
<br>
Solution of this equation is maximal integral manifold
of distribution $\CC(\EE)$
<br>
Let $N$ be $n$-dimensional manifold s graph of function
   $u=\varphi(x)$ such that it is  
the solution of differential equation defined by the surface $\EE$,
i.e. $N\subset \EE$ ,and for every point $\pb\in N$, 
tangent space $T_\pb N$ belongs
to the characteristic plane $\CC(\EE)_\pb$: all pints of $N$
belongs to $\EE$ and all tangent vectors
of  $N$  belong to the $T\EE$ and to contact plane\footnote
{$^{**}$}{Belonging to contact distribution is auto  
matical since every vector tangent to <tt> manifold</tt>
belongs to contact plane}.
Of course one may consider also generalised solutions......
<br>
<tt> Boundary condition</tt>: Take the $n-1$-dimensional surface,and
$\G$ on $\EE$.  Emit from the points of this surface the 
$n-1$-parametric family of curves which go in characteristic direction. 
We come locally in the vicinity of the surface $\G$ to $n$-dimensional
surface, it will be solution.
