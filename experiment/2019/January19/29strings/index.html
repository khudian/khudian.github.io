The questions which I discuss in the Blog last few days arised out
of the discussion with Grisha (Vekstein)  He asked me the question:why momentum propagates in the string if every point makes just vertical oscillations.
The answer is that  there are densities oscillations which move along; this is easy to see for the string : see below. Instead answering in this way the 
question  I decided "to touch the left ear by right hand": I considered
a string as circular  ring of BIG radius and using circulant matrices
  calculated normal modes,e.t.c.  This way seems to be stupid,
however the linear algebra which appear is interesting (Hadamard matrices,
 eigenvectors in $\bf C$ of circulant matrices) and I will retunr to this 
question.  However consider the simplest case:
<br>
 Let  string osillates :
                 $$
     {d^2x\over dt^2}+{k\over m}x=0\,, {\rm then}\quad
                 x(t)=A\cos \w t+B\sin \w t\,,\,\,{\rm where}\,,\quad
               \w=\sqrt {k\over m}
                 $$
This is for every point.
Why momentum propagates?  What is the velocity? Physisist will say that
                $$
             v_{\rm soun}=L\w\,.
                         $$
Why and how $L$ appears.

  Consider the density $\rho(x)$ which is depending on time,
