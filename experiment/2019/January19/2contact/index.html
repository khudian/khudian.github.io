   <h3> Geometry of diff.equations</h3>
<br>
  <h3> ${\S} 1$ Necessary mathematics from Arnold's book</h3>
<br>
<tt> I began to understand the pages in Arnold on diff. equations.....</tt>
<br>
Here it is:
<br>
<b> Definition</b>   Let $\w$ be $1$-form on $M$ which does not vanish.
. We say that it is
<i> contact</i> form if 
       $$
\hbox{$2$-form $d\w$ is non-degenerate on the plane $\w=0$ in $TM$}
       $$
<br>
Since $d\w$ is not degenerate on $\w=0$ and $\w\not\equiv 0$
them ${\rm dim}\, M=2k+1$.
<br>
<b> Theorem</b>  Contact form is defined up to a function
(Valya had a talk on it!)  If $\w$ is contact form and
  $f\not=0$ then $f\a$ is contact also.
<br>

<br>
   Let $\cal K$ be a distributions of $2n$-dimensional planes in $TM$
such that $\w$ vanishes on these planes.
<br>
<div class="footnote-head">We say that this distribution is a contact structure</div>
<div class="footnote-body">
    One can say  that distribution of hyperplanes
    defines constant structure if an $1$-form which vanishes this dstribution is non-degenerated on it
</div>
<br>
<b> Theorem</b>  Let $N$ be a submanifold of $M$
which is an integral submanifold 
(not necessarily maximal)  of contact distribution $\cal K$,
i.e. for every point on $N$ the tangent  vectors belong to
this distribution.   Then ${\rm dim}\, N\leq n$,
where ${\rm dim}\,M \leq 2n+1$ 
<br>
<tt> Proof</tt>  Let $\w$ be an arbitrary non-zero 
form which vanishes at $\cal K$.   
Since a form $\w$ vanishes on vectors tangent to the manifold
$N$, the form $d\w$ vanishes on these vectors also:
               $$
\iota\colon N\subset M, \qquad
    d\left(\iota^* \w\big\vert_N\right)=
     \iota^* dw\big\vert_N=0\,.
               $$
Hence two arbitrary vectors are orthogonal to each other with
respect to this form.  If dimension of tangent plane is bigger
than $n$ then there exist at least two vectors which are not orthogonal,
since $d\w$ is not degenerate.
Now we apply this mathematics to the differential equations.
<br>

<br>
    <h3>${\S}2\,\,$  Geometry of first order equation</h3>
<br>
  Let  $J^1M$  be a space of first jets of functions on 
manifold $M$. Cooridnates on $J^1M$ are $(p_i,q^j,u)$,
where $q^j$ are coordinates on $M$.  Jet of every function  $u=u(x)$
has coordinates $\left(p_i={\p u\over \p x q^i},q^i,u\right)$.
<br>
Consider  $\CC$ , the Cartan 
 distribution of $2n$-dimensional planes in $J^1M$
defined by the form $\w=p_idq^i-du$
                      $$
\CC_\pb\subset T_\pb J^1M=\{
T_\pb (J^1M)\ni\X\colon\,\,\w(\X)=0 
                    \}\,,
                      $$
Vector field  
     $$
M^i{\p\over \p q^i}+
N_i{\p\over \p p_i}+A{\p\over \p u}\,
\hbox{belongs to Cartan distribution $\CC$ if $A=p_iM^i$}\,.
      $$
$\CC$ is non-integrable distribution.  It is a 
<i> contact structure</i> and
the form  $\w_C=p_idq^i=du$  is a contact form since
              $$
          d\w\big\vert_{\w=0}=dp_i\wedge dq^i
              $$
is non-degenerte form.
Consider differential equation,  
      $$
\EE\colon       F(p,q,u)=0\,.
      $$
Differential equation is sumbmanifold of codimension $1$
in the space $J^1(M)$.
<br>
The Cartan distribution  $\CC$ of hyperplanes on $J^1M$ 
defines distribution  $\CC(\EE)$ in $T\EE$:
                  $$
\CC(E)=\CC\cap T\EE\,.
                   $$
         $$
\X=
M^i{\p\over \p q^i}+
N_i{\p\over \p p_i}+A{\p\over \p u}\in \CC(\EE)\,\, {\rm if}\,\,
 A=p_iM^i \& 
\left(M^i{\p\over \p q^i}+
N_i{\p\over \p p_i}+A{\p\over \p u}\right)F(p,q,u)\big\vert_{F=0}=0\,.
          $$
<br>
This distribution is not integrable.
<br>
The solution of differential equation (1) is the maximal integral
  of the distribution.
<br>
What is the dimension of $N$?
<br>
Let  $N$ be an arbitrary solution.   Calculate its dimension.
Any tangent plane to $N$  belongs to Cartan distribution
and is tangent to $\EE$.   Consider an arbitrary
point $\pb \in N$, and consider the plane
$\a=\a_P= T_\pb N$. Calculate $\dim T_\pb N$.
<br>
<b> Fact</b>   $\dim T_\pb N\leq n$.  We proved it above, but
we repeat the considerations again.   Consider the form $\w_C$
on and its differential the form $d\w_C$ on $TN$.
The form $\w_C$ vanishes on $TN$, hence the form $d\w_C$
vanishes on $TN$ also.  On the other hand if $\dim N=p>n$,
then  this is not true, since form $d\w_C$ has rank $2$.
In coordinates:  in the vicinity of the point
$\pb$  one can choose local  coordinates
$\xi^1,\dots,\xi^{2n+1}$ such that 
in these coordinates
surface $N$  is given by equations 
$\xi^{p+1}=\dots=\xi^{2n+1}=0$ and
$d\w_C=d\xi^1\wedge d\xi^2+\dots +
d\xi^{2n-1}\wedge d\xi^{2n}$ 
(generalised Darboux Theorem). 
This contradicts to the condition $d\w_C\big\vert_N\equiv 0$
on $N$.
(In the case if dimension $N$  is maximal possible 
it is Lagrangian)           
<br>
Now we consider some properties of hypersurfces,
(recall that  hypersurface is differential equation)
<br>
<b> DEFINITION</b>   Let $\EE$  be an arbitrary hypersurface
  in $M$: $\dim \EE=2n$). (Hypersurface  $\EE$
may define  differential equation $F(q,u,p)=0$ ($\EE\colon F=0$))  
We say that the hypersurface $\EE$ is 
<i> non-characteristic hypersurface</i> if at every point $\pb$
the contact hyperplane 
(hyperplane of distribution $\CC$) and the tangent hyperplane
are transversal:
        $$
\CC_\pb\oplus T_pt M'=T_\pb M\Leftrightarrow
    \dim (\CC_\pb\cap M'\pb)=2n-1\,.
        $$
<br>
 
<br>
<b> DEFINITION</b>   Let   $\EE$ be an 
arbitrary non-characteristic hypersurface in $J^1(M)$.
<br>
 For an arbitrary point $\pb\in E$ consider the
$2n-1$ dimensional subspace $\Pi_\pb$ of 
tangent vectors which belong to contact space:
            $$
\Pi_\pb=\CC_\pb\cap T_\pb E\,,\qquad \,,\dim \Pi_\pb=2n-1
            $$
<br>
 
<br>
  Thus we define the distribution of $2n-1$-dimensional planes
on non-characteristic differential  equation $F=0$ (this equation
defines the surface $\EE$: $\EE\colon\,\, F=0$).
<br>
Now: <tt> VERY IMPORTANT STEP:</tt> 
On every characteristic plane
$\Pi_\pb=\CC_\pb\cap T_\pb E$, $d\w_C=
\sum_{i=1}^n dp_i\wedge dq^i$,
and since the dimension of $\Pi_\pb$ is equal to $2n-1$
then one can define the direction, such that $dw$ vanishes
along this direction, and it is unique!
<br>
<i>Problem</i>  Let  $\s in V^*$ 
be  covector in $V^*$ and let
$M_\s$, me hyperplane in $V$ which is
orthogonal to the covector $\ac$:
   $$
M_\ac=\{\x\in V\colon\quad \s(\x)=0\}
   $$
<br>
<b> Proposition</b> <i>  Subspaces $M_{\s_1}$
and  $M_{s_2}$ are transversal if and only if vectors
$\s_1,\s_2$  qre linearly independent, (not proportional
to each other)
<br>
<b> Theorem</b> Let $F=F(u,p_i,q^i)=0$ defines
hypersurface $\EE=\EE_F$, differential equation.
Let  covector $dF$ defined by equation, and
covector  $\w_C$ of contact distribution,
<div class="footnote-head">are not proportional</div><div class="footnote-body">
    this condition does not depend on choice of function $F$
    defining the surface $\EE$
</div>  Then 
<br>
a) hypersurface $F=0$  is non-charcteristical
<br>
b) the charcteristic direction $l$  is defined by the vector
   $\X_F$
<br>
<b> Remark</b> If we change $F\to \lambda F$ where 
a function $\l$ is not-degenerate on the surface $F=0$,
then the condition of linear (in)dependence of covectors
   $dF$ and $\w_C$, and the characteristic 
direction $\X_F$  will not change.</i>
