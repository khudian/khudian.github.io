Here it is:
<br>
{\bf Definition}   Let $\w$ be $1$-form on $M$ which does not vanish.
. We say that it is
{\it contact} form if 
       $$
\hbox{$2$-form $d\w$ is non-degenerate on the plane $\w=0$ in $TM$}
       $$
<br>
Since $d\w$ is not degenerate on $\w=0$ and $\w\not\equiv 0$
them ${\rm dim}\, M=2k+1$.
<br>
{\bf Theorem}  Contact form is defined up to a function
(Valya had a talk on it!)  If $\w$ is contact form and
  $f\not=0$ then $f\a$ is contact also.
<br>
\m
<br>
   Let $\cal K$ be a distributions of $2n$-dimensional planes in $TM$
such that $\w$ vanishes on these planes.
<br>
We say that this distribution is a contct structure
\footnote{$^*$}{One can say  that distribution of hyperplanes
 defines constant structure if an $1$-form which vanishes this dstribution is non-degenerated on it}
<br>
{\bf Theorem}  Let $N$ be a submanifold of $M$
which is an integral submanifold 
(not necessarily maximal)  of contact distribution $\cal K$,
i.e. for every point on $N$ the tangent  vectors belong to
this distribution.   Then ${\rm dim}\, N\leq n$,
where ${\rm dim}\,M \leq 2n+1$ 
<br>
{\tt Proof}  Let $\w$ be an arbitrary non-zero 
form which vanishes at $\cal K$.   
Since a form $\w$ vanishes on vectors tangent to the manifold
$N$, the form $d\w$ vanishes on these vectors also:
               $$
\iota\colon N\subset M, \qquad
    d\left(\iota^* \w\big\vert_N\right)=
     \iota^* dw\big\vert_N=0\,.
               $$
Hence two arbitrary vectors are orthogonal to each other with
respect to this form.  If dimension of tangent plane is bigger
than $n$ then there exist at least two vectors which are not orthogonal,
since $d\w$ is not degenerate.
Now we apply this mathematics to the differential equations.

\bf Geometry of first order equation}

  Let  $J^1M$  be a space of first jets of functions on 
manifold $M$. Cooridnates on $J^1M$ are $(p_i,q^j,u)$,
where $q^j$ are coordinates on $M$.  Jet of every function  $u=u(x)$
has coordinates $\left(p_i={\p u\over \p x q^i},q^i,u\right)$.
<br>
Consider  $\C$ , the Cartan 
 distribution of $2n$-dimensional planes in $J^1M$
defined by the form $\w=p_idq^i-du$
                      $$
\C_\pt\subset T_\pt J^1M=\{
T_\pt (J^1M)\ni\X\colon\,\,\w(\X)=0 
                    \}\,,
                      $$
Vector field  
     $$
M^i{\p\over \p q^i}+
N_i{\p\over \p p_i}+A{\p\over \p u}\,
\hbox{belongs to Cartan distribution $\C$ if $A=p_iM^i$}\,.
      $$
$\C$ is non-integrable distribution.  It is a 
{\it contact structure} and
the form  $\w_C=p_idq^i=du$  is a contact form since
              $$
          d\w\big\vert_{\w=0}=dp_i\wedge dq^i
              $$
is non-degenerte form.
Consider differential equation,  
      $$
\E\colon       F(p,q,u)=0\,.
      $$
Differential equation is sumbmanifold of codimension $1$
in the space $J^1(M)$.
<br>
The Cartan distribution  $\C$ of hyperplanes on $J^1M$ 
defines distribution  $\C(\E)$ in $T\E$:
                  $$
\C(E)=\C\cap T\E\,.
                   $$
         $$
\X=
M^i{\p\over \p q^i}+
N_i{\p\over \p p_i}+A{\p\over \p u}\in \C(\E)\,\, {\rm if}\,\,
 A=p_iM^i \& 
\left(M^i{\p\over \p q^i}+
N_i{\p\over \p p_i}+A{\p\over \p u}\right)F(p,q,u)\big\vert_{F=0}=0\,.
          $$
<br>
This distribution is not integrable.
<br>
The solution of differential equation (1) is the maximal integral
  of the distribution.
<br>
What is the dimension of $N$?
<br>
Let  $N$ be an arbitrary solution.   Calculate its dimension.
Any tangent plane to $N$  belongs to Cartan distribution
and is tangent to $\E$.   Consider an arbitrary
point $\pt \in N$, and consider the plane
$\a=\a_P= T_\pt N$. Calculate $\dim T_\pt N$.
<br>
{\bf Fact}   $\dim T_\pt N\leq n$.  We proved it above, but
we repeat the considerations again.   Consider the form $\w_C$
on and its differential the form $d\w_C$ on $TN$.
The form $\w_C$ vanishes on $TN$, hence the form $d\w_C$
vanishes on $TN$ also.  On the other hand if $\dim N=p>n$,
then  this is not true, since form $d\w_C$ has rank $2$.
In coordinates:  in the vicinity of the point
$\pt$  one can choose local  coordinates
$\xi^1,\dots,\xi^{2n+1}$ such that 
in these coordinates
surface $N$  is given by equations 
$\xi^{p+1}=\dots=\xi^{2n+1}=0$ and
$d\w_C=d\xi^1\wedge d\xi^2+\dots +
d\xi^{2n-1}\wedge d\xi^{2n}$ 
(generalised Darboux Theorem). 
This contradicts to the condition $d\w_C\big\vert_N\equiv 0$
on $N$.
(In the case if dimension $N$  is maximal possible 
it is Lagrangian)           
<br>
Now we consider some properties of hypersurfces,
(recall that  hypersurface is differential equation)
<br>
{\bf DEFINITION}   Let $\E$  be an arbitrary hypersurface
  in $M$: $\dim \E=2n$). (Hypersurface  $\E$
may define  differential equation $F(q,u,p)=0$ ($\E\colon F=0$))  
We say that the hypersurface $\E$ is 
{\it non-characteristic hypersurface} if at every point $\pt$
the contact hyperplane 
(hyperplane of distribution $\C$) and the tangent hyperplane
are transversal:
        $$
\C_\pt\oplus T_pt M'=T_\pt M\Leftrightarrow
    \dim (\C_\pt\cap M'\pt)=2n-1\,.
        $$
<br>
\medskip
<br>
{\bf DEFINITION}   Let   $\E$ be an 
arbitrary non-characteristic hypersurface in $J^1(M)$.
<br>
 For an arbitrary point $\pt\in E$ consider the
$2n-1$ dimensional subspace $\Pi_\pt$ of 
tangent vectors which belong to contact space:
            $$
\Pi_\pt=\C_\pt\cap T_\pt E\,,\qquad \,,\dim \Pi_\pt=2n-1
            $$
<br>
\medskip
<br>
  Thus we define the distribution of $2n-1$-dimensional planes
on non-characteristic differential  equation $F=0$ (this equation
defines the surface $\E$: $\E\colon\,\, F=0$).
<br>
Now: {\tt VERY IMPORTANT STEP:} 
On every characteristic plane
$\Pi_\pt=\C_\pt\cap T_\pt E$, $d\w_C=
\sum_{i=1}^n dp_i\wedge dq^i$,
and since the dimension of $\Pi_\pt$ is equal to $2n-1$
then one can define the direction, such that $dw$ vanishes
along this direction, and it is unique!
<br>
{\sl Problem}  Let  $\s in V^*$ 
be  covector in $V^*$ and let
$M_\s$, me hyperplane in $V$ which is
orthogonal to the covector $\ac$:
   $$
M_\ac=\{\x\in V\colon\quad \s(\x)=0\}
   $$
<br>
{\bf Proposition} {\it  Subspaces $M_{\s_1}$
and  $M_{s_2}$ are transversal if and only if vectors
$\s_1,\s_2$  qre linearly independent, (not proportional
to each other)
<br>
{\bf Theorem} Let $F=F(u,p_i,q^i)=0$ defines
hypersurface $\E=\E_F$, differential equation.
Let  covector $dF$ defined by equation, and
covector  $\w_C$ of contact distribution,
are not proportional\footnote{$^*$}{
this condition does not depend on choice of function $F$
defining the surface $\E$}  Then 
<br>
a) hypersurface $F=0$  is non-charcteristical
<br>
b) the charcteristic direction $l$  is defined by the vector
   $\X_F$
<br>
{\bf Remark} If we change $F\to \lambda F$ where 
a function $\l$ is not-degenerate on the surface $F=0$,
then the condition of linear (in)dependence of covectors
   $dF$ and $\w_C$, and the characteristic 
direction $\X_F$  will not change.
<br>

<br>
The vectors
in tangent plane belong to distribution $\C_\E=\C\cap\E$,
i.e. they are orthogonal to the covector ($1$-form) 
in $2n+1$-dimensional
space
            $$
  \w_C=(1,0,\dots,0,-p_1,\dots, -p_n)\,,
  \quad\hbox{ (the vector belongs to Cartan distribution $\C$)} 
            $$
and to the covector
     $$
dF=
         \left(
      F_u,
  {\p F\over \p q^1}, \dots ,{\p F\over \p q^n};
  {\p F\over \p p_1}, \dots {\p F\over \p p_n}
          \right)\,,
\qquad
  \hbox {(the vector is tangent to the differential equation $\E=0$)}

    $$
\a_\pt\ni\X\Leftrightarrow  \w_C(\X)=dF(\X)=0\,.

{\bf Definition}  The point $\pt$ is not singular point if
tnhe rank of the matrix $\pmatrix {\w_C\cr  dF\cr}$  is equal to $2$.
