  	 I like on geometry lectures to consider an example:
  simultaneous equations
   $\cases 
   {
 A_1x+B_1y+C_1 z=D_1\cr $
 A_2x+B_2y+C_2 z=D_2\cr 
     }$
have no solutions or more than one solution, since

two planes are parallel, or intersect by the line,

Yes, it is true, but one of HILBERT axioms is the following:

if two planes $\a,\beta$ intersect at a point $A$, then there is
at least one another point of intersection.....
