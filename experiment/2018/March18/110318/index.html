<h3>Dear Martyn</h3>
<br>
  <tt> I am sure that you know or almost know what I want to  speak here about, but I think that better to fix it again</tt>
<br>
 You understand well why every lattice defines the point
  $(x,y), y>0$ in Lobachevsky plane.
   The are two things that have to be done.
<br>
1. (See Nikulin, Shafarevitch ${\S}14 $)
<br>
  Two lattices 
$\G_{\ac,\b}$, 
$\G_{\ac',\b'}$  are the same if 
             $$
  \pmatrix{\ac'\cr\b'\cr}=
  \pmatrix{p & q\cr m&n \cr}
  \pmatrix{\ac\cr\b\cr}\,,
  \quad {\rm where}\,\,
  \hbox {$p,q,m,n,$ are integers such that $pn-qm=\pm 1$}\,.
           $$
       This means that the group $SL_2({\bf Z})$
($2\times 2$ unimodular matrices with integer entires)
 acts on the Lobachevsky plane, and the distance has to
be invariant under the action of this group.
<br>

<br>
Going  from this group to Mobius group, we just change the
coefficients:
        $$
       SL_2(\Z)=
       \left\{
 \pmatrix{p & q\cr m&n \cr}\,, \hbox {such that}\,\,
   p,m,q,n \in\Z\, {\rm and}\,
    pn-pq=1
         \right\}\Rightarrow
        $$
        $$
    \Rightarrow
       SL_2(\R)=
       \left\{
 \pmatrix{a & b\cr c&d \cr}\,, \hbox {such that}\,\,
   a,b,c,d \in\R\, {\rm and}\,
    ad-bc=1
         \right\}\,.
        $$
<br>
We come to the problem to find the metric which is invariant
with respect to this group.
<br>
$$ $$
<br>
2.   We have to show that vertical lines and
half-circles with centre
at absolute ($y=0$) are geodesics on Lobachevsky plane.
This is vital for our considerations.
<br>
<b> Lemma</b>  <i> Let $F\not={\bf id}$ be an isometry of 
Riemannian manifold,
and let $F={\bf id}$ at the points of curve $C$.
Then curve $C$ is geodesic!
</i>
<br>
<i>This lemma is founded on the remark of the book
  Nikulin, Shafarevich (${\S} 16, p.2$)
</i>
<br>
  It will be great tomorrow to discuss this.
<br>
  I will be all the day in office.
