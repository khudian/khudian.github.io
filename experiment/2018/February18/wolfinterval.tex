   We know that fifth $={3\over 2}$ and on the piano
 it is equal to ${3\over 2} $
if we have 12 fifths it will take 7 octaves we come to:
              $$
  \left(3\over 2\right)^{12}\approx 2^7\Leftrightarrow
   {3^{12}\over 2^{12+7}}=
   {3^{12}\over 2^{19}}={531441\over 524288}\approx 1\,.
              $$
About thirty years  ago we played with David phoning to 
people to $531441$ and $524288$
