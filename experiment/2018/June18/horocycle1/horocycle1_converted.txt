Today I have began to understand the synthetic definition of 
{\tt horocycle}:
<br>
Let $\Pi$ be a pencil of lines which are parallel to each other
in the sqme direction.
 Conisder an isometry  $F$ such that it sends every line of this pencil
to another (maybethe smae?) line of thispencil.
 Let $l$ be an arbitrary line of the pencil $\Pi$,
and let $A$ be an arbitrary point on $l$
Since $F$ is isometry then the line between the point $A$
and its image the point $A'$ has the SAME ANGLES with lines
   $l$ and $l'=F(l)$.
<br>
Let a line $r$ does not change under this transformation: 
   $$
\forall A\in r, F(A)\in r
   $$
The line $r$ is called HOROCYCLE
