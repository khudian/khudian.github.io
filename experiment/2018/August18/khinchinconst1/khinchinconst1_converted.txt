    Remarkable fact:
<br>
  almost for every real number
mea geometric of its components is equal to
$K$=
<br>
On the othern hand note that for rational numbers
   $K=1$  for quadratic irrationalities it  has nothing to 
do with $K$. It is in the space of all real numbers 
the meausure of exceptions is equal to zero!:wq
<br>
I affraid to tell but this statement is beautiful,
but it is not workable in the ``real''  mathematics:
