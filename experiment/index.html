 <h2>Symmetries of Clairaut equation</h2>


It is well-known that the Clairaut equation
       $$
 y-xy'=f(y')
\tag{1} $$
has the one-parametric family of solutions:
       $$
     y=kx+f(k)
       \tag{2a}
       $$
and the special soluction, their envelope: $\varphi(x)$,
     $$
\varphi(x)=k(x)x+f(k(x))\colon\quad
    {\p\varphi\over k}=x+f'(k)=0\,.
      \tag {2b}
     $$
This is standard.


On the other hand the Clairaut equation (1)
can be approached in the following way:



Consider in $3$-dimensional space  $E$ $=(p,x,y)$ ($p=y'$)
the following transformation
        $$
(x,p,y)\to (\tilde x,\tilde p,\t y)\quad
\cases {\t x=p\cr\t p=-x\cr \t y=y-px}
        $$
This is so called Legendre transformation of contact space
$E$.  Under this transformation the
characteristic $1$-form $pdx-dy$ is not changed
\footnote{}{the transformation (2a)  preserves the 
distribution of planes defined by
$1$-form $pdx-dy$, thus it can be applied to an arbitrary
differential equation $F(x,p,y)=0$ ($p=y'$).},
and  the Clairaut equation
transforms to the algebraic equation 
        $$
   \t y=f(\t x)
        $$,
every solution (2a) 
is transformed
to the generalised solution, the line
   $\cases {\t x=k\cr \t p=\hbox {arbitrary number}\cr
          \t y=f(k)\cr}$,
and the special solution (2b), $y=\varphi(x)$
is transformed to the solution, the curve
   $\cases {\t x= t \cr 
            \t p=  f'(t)\cr
             \t y=f(t)\cr}$,


Our aim to find the <i>one-parametric famiily
  of contact trasnformations which include the Legendre transformation and see how look the image of solutions (2a), (2b)
under this transformation.</i>

Consider the Hamiltnian $H={p^2\over 2}+{x^2\over 2}$
of harmonic oscillator.  This Hamiltonian 
defines the contact vector field
        $$
   \X_H={\p H\over \p p}{\p\over \p x}-
   {\p H\over \p x}{\p\over \p p}+
   \left(p{\p H\over \p p}-H\right){\p\over \p y}\,,
        $$
and it induces
the contact transformation
   $$
  \pmatrix {x\cr p\cr y\cr}\to
  \pmatrix {\t x_t\cr \t p_t\cr \t y_t\cr}\,,
  $$
such that 
        $$
\cases {
{d {\t x}\over dt}={\p H\over \p {\t p}}=\t p\cr
{d {\t p}\over dt}=-{\p H\over \p {\t x}}=-\t x\cr
{d {\t y}\over dt}= \left(
    {{\t p}^2\over 2}
    -{{\t x}^2\over 2}
          \right) 
        \cr
}
        $$
Solving this equation and taking in account the boudnary
conditions
     $$
  \pmatrix {\t x_t\cr \t p_t\cr \t y_t\cr}\big\vert_{t=0}=
  \pmatrix { x\cr  p\cr  y\cr}
     $$
we come to
     $$
 \cases
  {
  x_t=x\cos t+p\sin t\cr
  p_t=-x\sin t+p\cos t\cr
  y_t=y+
 {1\over 4}p^2\sin 2t
 -{1\over 4}x^2\sin 2t
 +{1\over 2}px\left(\cos 2t-1\right)\cr
       }
       $$
We see that for $t=0$ this is identity contact transformation,
and for $t={\pi\over 2}$ this the Legendre trasnformation
 $$
 \cases
  {
  x_{\pi\over 2}=p\cr
  p_{\pi\over 2}=-x\cr
  y_{\pi\over 2}=y-px\cr
       }
       $$
       
<h2>Fermat</h2>
  Few days ago Yurij Bazlov told me about one very beautiful problem
   were Fermat (small)  Theorem appears.

   The problem is following. 

Calculate the number 
of subsets of the set $\{1,2,3,\dots, p\}$
such that the number $p$ divides the sum of elements in this subset. 
Suppose that $p$ is a prime number.


 This problem  was given to schoolkids on something like 
International Olympiad.

In this problem the Fermat (small) theorem is unexpectably appears.

   Yurij solved this problem in a very beautiful way.

I spent the Saturday aolving this problem; as a result I failed
to produce the coursework in a time, however,
 I solved it {\tt Paris il vaut bien une messe!}.

My solution is the following:

   Consider polynomial
           $$
  P_p(x)=(1+x)(1+x^2)(1+x^3)\dots (1+x^p)
           $$
where $x$ is undeterminate, and show that
           $$
  P_p(x)=1+C_p{x^{p}-1\over x-1}\,.
           $$
       

<h2>Udiviteljnoje riadom</h2>

Yurij Bazlov gave me to solve the following problem:

{\it     For natural number $N$
consider the set   $\{1,2,3,\dots,N\}$.
Calculate  the number of subsets of this set such that
the sum of elements of this subset is divisible on $p$.

 }

Thinking about this problem I fomrulated  the following identity:
            $$
  (1+x)(1+x^2)\dots(1+x^{p-1})=
    1+C_p(1+x+\dots+x^{p-1})\,, \,, C_p={2^{p-1}-1\over p} 
            $$
which is obeyed if $p$ is prime number and $x^p=1$.


This  identity leads to the fact that
number of subsets where sum  of the elements has given remainder
if we divide on $p$  is equal to  $2C_p-1$.
This is for prime $p$.  

I came to
this identity experimentally.
   What happens if $N$ is not prime?
This is true
identity for the free ring with constraint $x^p=1$, and on
the other hand  if
$x$ is primitive root, then left hand
side is equal to $1$.

    Now I realise what happened:
     Consider examples:
  Denote  by
    $$
     P_N(x)=(1+x)(1+x^2\dots (1+x^{N-1})
   $$
and denote by
       $$
T_N(x)=1+x+x^2+\dots+x^{N-1}
        $$
We have that if $N=p$  is a prime then $T_N$ is irreducible polynomial
of $\vare_p=e^{2\pi\sqrt{-1}\over p}$.


   We have       
 $$ 
P_3(x)=1+T_3(x)\,,\quad \hbox {and $P_3(\vare_3)=1$}\,, 
$$
 $$ 
P_5(x)=1+3T_5(x)\,,\quad \hbox {and $P_5(\vare_5)=1$}\,, 
$$
  \bye
 $$ 
P_7(x)=1+9T_7(x)\,,\quad \hbox {and $P_7(\vare_7)=1$}\,, 
$$
 $$ 
P_{11}(x)=1+93T_{11}(x)\,,\quad \hbox {and $P_{11}(\vare_{11})=1$}\,, 
$$
 $$ 
P_{13}(x)=1+315T_{13}(x)\,,\quad \hbox {and $P_{13}(\vare_{13})=1$}\,, 
$$
However


 $$ 
P_4(x)=2T_4(x)\,,\quad \hbox {and $P_4(\vare_4)=0$}\,, 
$$
 $$ 
P_6(x)=5T_5(x)+5(x^3+1)\,,\quad \hbox {and $P_6(\vare_6)=0$}\,, 
$$
 $$ 
P_8(x)=5T_5(x)+5(x^3+1)\,,\quad \hbox {and $P_6(\vare_6)=0$}\,, 
$$

<h2>Music</h2>
We have :
    $$
{3\over 2}=2^x=2^{1\over a_0+{1\over a_1+\dots}}
 \Rightarrow
\left({3\over 2}\right)^{a_0+{1\over a_1+{1\over a_2+\dots}}}=2\,.
    $$
We have that ${3\over 2}<2<{9\over 4}$, hence $a_0=1$.

Thus we have that
     $$
{3\over 2}=  2^{1\over 1+{1\over a_1+\dots}}\Rightarrow
\left({3\over 2}\right)^{1+{1\over a_1+{1\over a_2+\dots}}}=2
\Rightarrow 
\left({4\over 3}\right)^{a_1+{1\over a_2+{1\over a_3+\dots}}}=
{3\over 2}\,.
$$
We have that ${4\over 3}<{3\over 2}<\left({4\over 3}\right)^2$, 
hence $a_1=1$.
