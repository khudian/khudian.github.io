This is the page with the general information about writing tex articles in html

The engine which is rendering the formulas is called MathJax. 
In the beginning of every file you have something like:

  <script type="text/javascript" async src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.5/latest.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML"></script>  

Which means that each time you load the html with latex formulas, it downloads the scripts from that source. This script runs on your browser
and converts the latex formulas to the 'real' formulas which you see on the screen. 
Mathjax is very powerful and supports even latex 'defs'. The configuration for them
can be found in the file config.js. Note the latex 'defs' which are placed in config.js are applied globally to all the articles. So it 
is important to be consistent in using 'defs' throughout the articles.  


Which commands are not working in MathJax:

For latex formulas:
1) $\eqno (1a)$     =>    $\tag{1a}$ (for formulas numbering)
2) $\cal c$         =>    $\rfloor$ (for ⌋)
3) $\cal x$         =>    $\S$ (for §) 
4) Don't redefine $\S$ as ${\cal S}$ or as anything else, since $\S$ is used for the "paragraph sign" §.
5) $a<b$            =>    $a < b$ or $a< b$ (Mathjax would not render a formula if the "<" sign 
                          there is glued with the next character)

For the text formating outside of latex formulas:
1) {\bf example}    =>    <b>example</b>
2) {\it example}    =>    <i>example</i>
3) {\tt example}    =>    <tt>example</tt>
4) blackbox \finish works only inside the formula $\finish$: no need to write $\hbox{\finish}$
5) a ---- b         =>    a &mdash; b
6) "break line"     =>    <br>
7) \medskip         =>    <br><br>
8) \bigskip         =>    <br><br><br>

9) \footnote        =>    <div class="footnote-head">
                            This is footnote head
                          </div>
                          <div class="footnote-body">
                            This is footnote body
                          </div>
