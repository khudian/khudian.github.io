This is the page with the general information about writing tex articles in html

which commands are not working:

\eqno (1a) => \tag{1a}
\cal c => \rfloor
\cal x => \S
Don't define \S as \Sigma, since it would conflict with the "paragraph sign" \S = ยง 
blackbox \finish works only inside the formula $\finish$: no need to write $\hbox{\finish}$
