This is the page with the general information about writing tex articles in html

which commands are not working:

For latex formulas:
1) $\eqno (1a)$     =>    $\tag{1a}$ (for formulas numbering)
2) $\cal c$         =>    $\rfloor$ (for ⌋)
3) $\cal x$         =>    $\S$ (for §) 
4) Don't redefine $\S$ as ${\cal S}$ or anything else, since it $\S$ is used for the "paragraph sign" §.
5) $a<b$            =>    $a < b$ or $a< b$ (Mathjax would not render the formula if there is the "<" sign 
                          which is glued with the next character

For the text formating outside of latex formulas:
1) {\bf example}    =>    <b>example</b>
2) {\it example}    =>    <i>example</i>
3) {\tt example}    =>    <tt>example</tt>
4) blackbox \finish works only inside the formula $\finish$: no need to write $\hbox{\finish}$
5) a ---- b         =>    a &mdash; b
6) "break line"     =>    <br>
7) \medskip         =>    <br><br>
8) \bigskip         =>    <br><br><br>
