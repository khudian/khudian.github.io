This is the page with the general information about writing tex articles in html

which commands are not working:

For latex formulas:
1) \eqno (1a)     =>    \tag{1a} (for formulas numbering)
2) \cal c         =>    \rfloor (for ⌋)
3) \cal x         =>    \S (for §) don't define \S as \Sigma, 
since it would conflict with the "paragraph sign" \S = § 

For the text formating outside of latex formulas:
1) {\bf example}  =>    <b>example</b>
2) {\it example}  =>    <i>example</i>
3) {\tt example}  =>    <tt>example</tt>
4) blackbox \finish works only inside the formula $\finish$: no need to write $\hbox{\finish}$
5) a ---- b       =>    a &mdash; b
6) \medskip       =>    <br><br>
