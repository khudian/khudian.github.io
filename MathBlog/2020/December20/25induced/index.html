<h2><b> Induced connection.</b></h2>
 
 <i> Here we describe standard deriving for induced connection
 (see my lecture course) with  some details.
 In particular we will focus special attention on
 <tt> prolongation</tt></i><br><br>

    Let $(M,G)$ be an $n$-dimenisonal
    Riemannian manifold, and let $C$ be $k$-dimensional surface ib $M$.
    One can consider  Levi-Civita connection of metric induced on
    $C$. However this connection coicides with induced connection
              $$
	      \nabla^{(C)}_\X\Y=
	      \left[\nabla_\X\Y\right]_{||}\,,
	      \tag{1}
	         $$
if $\nabla$ is Levi-Civita connectiona of metric $G$ in $M$.
THis fact follows from uniqueness of Levi-Civita connection.
[In (1) $X_{||}$ means component of $\X$ tangent to $C$.]
[See my lecture course]. However   application of formula (1)
has one delicate problem: we have to consider vector fields
  $\X,\Y$ in the vicinity of the surface.
 During many years
I 'swallowed' it in my course. Here I try to be more delicate,
writing induced connection (1).<br><br>
Let $x^i(\xi^\a)$ be a manifold $M$, and $\X,\Y$ two vector fields on $M$.
   In tubular neighbourhood of $C$ consider prolongations of these fileds:
   arbitrary vector fields
   $\hat \X$ and $\hat\Y$ such that they coincide with fields
   $\X,\Y$ on $C$:
               $$
	       \hat\X\big\vert_{C}=\X\,,\quad
	       \hat\Y\big\vert_{C}=\Y\,
	       \tag{1a}
	         $$
   write down formula (1) properly in terms of prolongations:
         $$
	      \nabla^{(C)}_\X\Y=
	     \left[ 
	     \left(\nabla_{\hat\X}\hat \Y\right)_C
	     \right]_{||}\,.
	     \tag{1b}
	  $$
This is the well-defined  formula for the induced  connection.<br><br>
<tt> Proof</tt>  One can easy to see that this is a connecition,
and it preserves scalar product, hence by uniqueness it 
 is Levi-Civita connection  of induced metric on $C$.
It is not worthless to perform calculations, in spite of the fact that
this proof allows to calculate the induced connection
as the Levi-Civita connection of induced metric:
         $$
	\Gamma^{\gamma}_{\a\beta}=
	{1\over 2} g^{\gamma\sigma}
	\left(
	{\p g_{\a\sigma}(\xi)\over \p \xi^\beta}
	     +
	{\p g_{\beta\sigma}(\xi)\over \p \xi^\a}
	    -
	{\p g_{\a\beta}(\xi)\over \p \xi^\sigma}
	\right)\,,
	\tag{1c} 
	 $$
where  the induced metric is defined by the metric in $M$:
          $$
	  g_{\a\beta}(\xi)=
	  \left\langle,
      \r_\a,\r_\beta
	  \right\langle_G=
	    x^i_\a(\xi)G_{ij}\left(x(\xi)\right)
	      x^j_\beta(\xi)\,.
	      \tag{1d}
	   $$
	 Neverheless try to calculate the induced connection
	 without use of Levi-Civita Theorem.<br><br>
    Cosider vector fields on $C$:
         $$
	\r_\a={\p x^i(\xi) \over \p \xi^\a} \p_i
	\tag{2}
	 $$
and denote by $\R_\a$ the prolongation of the field $\r_\a$
on tubular neighbourhood of $C$. We have that
           $$
	   \left[
\left(
  \nabla^{(M)}_{\R_\a}\R_\beta
\right)_{C}
	   \right]_{||}=
	   \Gamma_{\a\beta}^\gamma\r_\gamma\,,
	   \tag{2a}
	   $$
        where $\Gamma_{\a\beta}^\gamma$ are Christoffel symbols
	   of induced connection on $C$.
One can see that
            $$
  \nabla^{(M)}_{\R_\a}\R_\beta=
  \nabla_{\r_\a+\dots}\left(\r_\beta+\dots\right)=
  x^i_{\a\beta}\p_i+x^i_\a x^j_\beta\Gamma_{ij}^m\p_m+\dots\,,
  \tag{2b}
	    $$
	    where we denote by $\dots$ terms 
	    whcih vanish on manifold $C$.
It follows from this equation that for the induced connection
           $$
	   \nabla^{(C)}_{\r_\a}\r_\beta=
	   \Gamma^{(C)\gamma}_{\a\beta}
	   \r_{\gamma}
	   =
	   \r_{\a\beta}+
	   x^i_\a
	   x^j_\beta \Gamma^{(M)m}_{ij}\p_m\,,
	   $$
	   where
$\{\Gamma^{(C)\gamma}_{\a\beta}\}$ Christoffel symbols of
induced connection (see equation (1d)), and
$\{\Gamma^{(M) m}_{ij}\}$ Christoffel symbols of
of connection in $M$ (which may be is Levi-Civita connecction of G).
Take the scalar product of the lasst equation with arbitrary
tangent vector $\r_\beta$.  We come t
