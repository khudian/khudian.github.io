<h3>Moduli space, what is it</h3><br><br>
<br><br><br><br>
One of students asked me a question: Moduli spaces, What is it?<br><br>
   Suppose that we consider (usually infinite-dimensioanl) 
   space, where  we perform 
   some identifications. We come by this identification to
   moduli space if the remaining degrees of freedom still take
   continuous values.   
 <br><br>
       Consider examples.<br><br>

       <b> First example</b><br><br>
          Consider a space of vector fields on $\R$.  We identify
	  two vector fields $\A=A(x){\p\over \p x}$ 
	  and $\C=C(x){\p\over \p x}$ if there exists
	  diffeomorphism $F\colon \R\to\R$ which connects these fields,
	  i.e.
	         $$
		 \A=F_* \C\,,\quad\colon\,\,\,
     A(x){\d F(x)\over dx}=C(y)\big\vert_{y=F(x)}\,.
         \tag{1}
	$$
<b> Exercise</b> 
     Consider vector fields 
       $\A=x{d\over dx}$ and
       $\C=3y{d\over dy}$.
One can see that map 
        $$
	y=x^3
	$$
conneccts these fields, however this map <tt> is not!!!</tt> the 
diffeomorphism, and one can see that these vector fields
cannot be identified by any diffeomorphism!<br><br>
We see in this example that moduli space of vector fields on $\R$
with identification as above contains line:vector fields
  $\lambda x{d\over dx}$ and
  $\mu x{d\over dx}$  can be identified if and only if $\lambda=\mu$.<br><br>
<br><br><br><br>
  <b> Second example</b>
   This is very important example, however i afraid,
   that I do not remember this clear..
 Consider the space of two-dimensional
  Riemannian surfaces which are diffeomorphic to $S_1\times S_1$.<br><br>
  We identify  two tori  if they are conformally isometric to each other.<br><br>
  ``In the previous example we showed that the space of vector fields
  factorised by relation (1) contains the line, since
  two vector fields 
  $\lambda x{d\over dx}$ 
 and  $\mu x{d\over dx}$ 
  are not identical to each other if $\lambda\not=\mu$.
  In the same way we will give an example of subspace of 
  tori such that two different elements 
  are not conformally isometric to each other.
     Consider Lobachevsky plane and assign to every point 
     $\pt (x,y)\colon y>0$  parallelogram with sides
              $\pmatrix {x\cr y\cr}$
	      and 
              $\pmatrix {1\cr 0\cr}$.
	      This parallelogram defines surface of 
	      torus with Riemannian metric, and we will call
	      it $T_{x,y}$. One can see , 
	       that 
	       
	       <b> Theorem</b> Two tori $T_z$ and $T_{z'}$
	          $z=x+iy$  are conformally isometric
	       if snd only if
	            $$
		    z'={az+b\over cz+d}\,,\quad a,b,c,d\in \R, ad-bc\not=0\,.
		    $$
	      this is very beautiful theorem which explains why Hyperbolic
	      geometry is so important, that<br><br>
