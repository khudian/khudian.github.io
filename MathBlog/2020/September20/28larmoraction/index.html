<h2><b> Action in parallel magnetic and electric fields II)</b></h2><br><br>
<i> This is the short version of the previous blog.
  Here I emphasise cental moments of calulcation of the action.
  
  I never will stop to surprise the power of an action,
  in particular how the straightforward calculations
  of action of Lagrangian lead to function which obeys 
  Hamilton-Jacobi equation.  in two days it will be my official retirement...
  </i><br><br>
Here we will calculate the action of a particle which moves
in parallel electircal and magnetic fields.<br><br>
We will present here the short version of calculations
based on calculations of action in homogeneous
electric field (see the Blog on 24 September 2019).<br><br>
    Conisder Lagrangian in homogeneous electirc and magnetic
    fields directed along $z$-axis: 
         $$
	 L=       
{m(\dot x^2+\dot y^2+\dot z^2)\over 2}+
{eb\over 2c}(y\dot x-x\dot y)-mgz\,, 
\left(\hbox {we choose $\E=E\e_z$ such that $eEz=mgz$}\right)
       \tag{1a}	 
	 $$
respectively
      $$
      H=
      {\left(p_x-{yeb\over 2c}\right)^2\over 2m}
      +{\left(p_y+{xeb\over 2c}\right)^2\over 2m}+
      {p_z^2\over 2m}+mgz\,,\quad (e\varphi=mgz)\,
      \tag{1b}
      $$
     We have to calculate an action $W=W(T,r,\R)$.
     To do this we consider the trajectory  $x(\tau)$
     such that it starts at the point $\r$ at $0$
     and ends at the point $\R$ at the moment $\tau=T$
     (system is conservative):
      $$
    W(T,\r,\R)=\int_0^T L(x(\tau),\dot x(\tau))d\tau   
      \tag{1c}
      $$
<b> Remark</b> For not conseervative Lagrangians $W=W(t_1,\r,t_2,\R)$.
To calculate the action we consider the trajectory which begins
at the point $\r$ at $t_1$ and ends at the point  $\R$ at the moment $t_2$.
In the case if Lagrangian is conservative (it does not depend on
time) then  the action $W=W(t_1,\r,t_2=t_1+T,\R)$ 
does not depend on  $t_1$.<br><br>
Using some properties of action we already calculated
an action if magnetic interaction is absent (see the blog on  September 2019)"
          $$
W_0=W_{b=0}
(t_1,\r;t_2,\R)={m(\R-\r)^2\over 2T}-mg{z+Z\over 2}T-
{1\over 24}mg^2T^3\,,\quad (T=t_2-t_1)\,.	
\tag{2a}
	$$
The switching on of magnetic field leads to
        $$
W_b=W_0+{eb\over 2c}\int_C  ydx-xdy\,
\tag{2b},	
	$$
	where $C$ is the trajectory of the particle.
  The problem is reduced to differential geometry: we have to solve it!   <br><br>
It is convenient to introduce
       $$
     w=w_L={eb\over mc}
     \tag{3a}
       $$
    (so calledd 'Larmor' frequency.) 
 Partcile moves along the helix of the radius $R_L$.
 Denote by $\v_\perp$ the projection of the velocity on
 the $OXY$ plane.  We have that 
        $$
|\v_\perp|=R_Lw\,,\quad \v=\v_\perp-gt \e_z\,
\tag{3b}
	$$   
One can see (using Stokes formula) that
	$$
{eb\over 2c}\int_C ydx-xdy=
{mw\over 2}\int_C ydx-xdy={mw\over 2}{R^2\Phi\over 2}\,,
      \tag{3c}
       $$
    where $\Phi=wT$ is the angle of rotation of the particle,
    which moves along the helix.
    Thus using (3) we come to
       $$
{eb\over 2c}\int_C ydx-xdy=
{mw^2\v^2_\perp\over 4}\,.
      \tag{3d}
       $$
We have to calculate $\v_\perp$, (beter to say its length).)
Equations of motion are followjng:
       $$
    {\p L\over \p x}=   
       $$<br><br>
