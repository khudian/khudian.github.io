<h3><b> Recalling of reduction (Po sledam mojej pamiati)</b></h3><br><br>
Let $M$ be 
<div class="footnote-head"> 
  non-compact
</div>
<div class="footnote-body">
Ce n'est pas notre caprice:
if Initial space is non-compact, then the fact that recuced space has finite volume sounds emotionally striking!
</div>
 symplectic manifold. 

Let $F_i$ be $k$ unctions such that
     $$
     \{F_i,F_k\}=c_{ik}^jF_j
     \tag{1.1}
     $$
How looks reduction of $M$ to $F_i=p_i$.<br><br>
 To say $(1.1)$ in a 'noble' way:<br><br>

 Roughly speaking suppose the
action of Lie group $G$ of symplectomorphisms 
on $E^{2n}$ is defined, and it is compatible with (1). 
in particular
fundamental vector fields are defined:
to every vector $\X\in \GG$ at every point $e\in E^{2n}$
one can assign the infinitesimal curve $(1+t \X)\cdot e$.
Thus we define the map from Lie algebra to vector fields.
           $$
	\GG\ni\X,\Y\mapsto 
	\tilde {\X}\,,
	\tilde {\Y},
	\tilde {\left[\X,\Y\right]}
	=
	\pm\left[
		\tilde \X,
		\tilde \Y
		\right]
	   $$<br><br>
Then we can define 
<i> moment map</i> ${\bf J}(x)$ corresponding to this action.
Namely this means following:<br><br>
A moment map   $\J$ is a function on symplectic manifold
with values in 
<div class="footnote-head"> 
colagebra $\GG^*$ such that
</div>
<div class="footnote-body">
As usual coalgebra $\GG$ is a vector space linear functions on Lie
algebra $\GG$, where $\GG$ is a Lie algebra of the Lie group $G$.
</div>

for every $\xi\in \GG$, the Haniltonian vector field
 $D_{\J(\xi)}$ is equal to fundamental vecot field<br><br>

   Consider Hamiltonian reduction corresponding to this group action
   and to this moment map.<br><br>
 
            <h3> Point version</h3>
   Consider a fixed point $p\in \GG$. Let
         $$
	 M_p=
	 \{x\in E^{2n} \colon\,\, \J(x)=p
		 \}\,,\hbox{in components}\,\,
		 M_p=
		 \{x\in E^{2n} \colon\,\, F_i(x)=p_i\}
	  $$
$M_p$ is $2n-k$ dimensional surface.<br><br>

In the simplest case if group $G$ is one-dimensional, then
vector field $D_F$  is tangent to surface $M$.
We come to  reduced phase factorising $M$ over action of vector field.
It is much more convenient to perform reduction in temrs of functions:
we have to consider $2N-2$ functions on $2N-1$
dimensional surface $M$ which commute with
Hamiltonian $F$, i.e. which are invariant with respect to 
vector field $D_F$<br><br>

<br><br>
In the general case if $2N-k$-dimensional surface
$M$ is defined by conditions
       $$
       F_i=0\, i=1,\dots,k
    $$
    then it is not true that all the fields generated by Hamiltonians
    are tangent to surface!<br><br>
    What is a dimension of vecotr space of fields which are<br><br>
    a)  tangent to $M$<br><br>
    b) belong to group $G$<br><br>

   To answer this question we have to solve equation
             $$
	     \{H=t^iF_i, F_j\}=0
	     $$
We know from lemma about orbits in coalgebra that
if we act by Lie algebra on for $p\in \GG^*$, then there
are $2r$ vector fields which goes "out of the surface",
and $k-2r$ fields remain on the surface $M$.<br><br>
So variables of reduced space are such functions
on $2N-k$ fimensional surface which are invariant with
respect to $k-2r$ vecotr fields.  
Hence the dimension of reduced phase space is equal to
            $$
n=2N-k-(k-2r)=
  2(N-k+r)
	    $$
where $2N$ is dimension of initial symplectic space,
$k$ is dimension of symmetry group,
$2r$ is dimension of the orbit of action of adjoint of group on
level form $p$.<br><br>
