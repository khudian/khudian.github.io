<h3><b> Tropical analog of Ptolemy Theorem</b></h3><br><br>
 <i> If $a,b,c,d$ are lengths of the sides of
 the quadrangle which is inscribed in the circle,
   then
      $$
    ac+bd=ef\,,
      $$
where  $e,f$ are lengths of the diagonals of this
triangle.   THis is well-known Ptolemy's theorem
\footnote{$^{*}$}{it becomes fashionable to quote this
statemnet during talks in claster algebra}.
 Today Olga Kravhenko told me  about the beautiful
tropical analogue of this theorem[she learnt is 
in 1996 from Volodya Fock.</i><br><br>
<br><br>
Let $ABCD$  be a quadrangle in the plane which is 
laminated by the system $\cal C$ of curves. <br><br>

Denote by<br><br>
   $$
 a-\hbox {the number of curves of the lamination $\cal
C$ which intersect the side $AB$}\,,
     $$
   $$
 b-\hbox {the number of curves of the lamination $\cal
C$ which intersect the side $BC$}\,,
     $$
   $$
 c-\hbox {the number of curves of the lamination $\cal
C$ which intersect the side $CD$}\,,
     $$
   $$
 d-\hbox {the number of curves of the lamination $\cal
C$ which intersect the side $DA$}\,,
     $$
   $$
 e-\hbox {the number of curves of the lamination $\cal
C$ which intersect the digonal $AC$}\,,
     $$
   $$
 f-\hbox {the number of curves of the lamination $\cal
C$ which intersect the diagonal  $BD$}\,,
     $$
then in analogy with equation (1),
there is the same tropical identity, ie.
    $$
\max \{a+c,b+d\}=e+f\,.
