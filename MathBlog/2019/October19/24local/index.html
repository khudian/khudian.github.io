<h3><b> Localisation for pedestrians</b></h3><br><br>

Let $(M,\Omega)$  be $2n$-dimensional symplectic
manifold, with symplectic structure generated by closed
non-degenerate $2$-form $\Omega$.<br><br>

Let $H$ be a  Hamilronian on the $M$.<br><br>

If these conditions hold, then the integral
$\int_M e^{iH} dv$ can be <tt> localised</tt>.<br><br>
   What it means exactly.<br><br>
  We physisists will say something like:<br><br>
  <tt> localisation means that integral is defined
by the values of Hamiltonian and its derivatives
on some points like in stationary phase method; 
in fact it coincides with calculations which we perform
in stationary phase method</tt><br><br>
   In his paper Schwarz gives
a definition  of this conception in terms
of partition of unity.
He says particularly  the following:<br><br>

LET $U$ be an arbitrary 
open set which possesses the critical
points of Hamiltonian.  Then for every such open set
one can define the $\sqrt {\L_{D_H}}$  function
 ($\sqrt {\L_{\X}}=d_\X=d+{\cal c}\X$)
$\sigma_U$  such that this function vanishes
out of $U$ and it is equal to $1$ at the critical
points of Hamiltonian and
     $$
\int_M e^{iH}dv=
\int_M \sigma_U e^{iH}dv\,.
     $$<br><br>
We will make  calculations which make the
consensus between this mathemtical
difinition and  reasonable arguments of physysists
 that
   $$
localisation\,\, means\,\,
 that\,\, the \,integral\,\, 
equals\,\, to\, its\, quasicalssical\,\, value 
 exactly calculated by sationary phase method\,..
   $$
These calculations are founded on calculations
of Belavin and some ideas from the paper of Schwarz.<br><br>
we suppose
that there exists $1$-form $\omega$
which is invariant with respect to
the Hamiltonian vector  field $D_H$,
which is defined almost everywhere,
and such that the two form $\tilde\Omega=d\omega$ is
non-degenerate (in the domain where $\omega$ is
defined):<br><br>

  i) it  is defined 
 almost on the all $M$, i.e. it is defined
at least on the open domain $D$ in $M$  such that
its volume (with respect to $\Omega$) coinsides with 
the volume of $M$ (with respect to $\tilde \Omega$ or
$\Omega$,)
           $$
    \int_D \Omega^n=
    \int_M \Omega^n\,.
            $$<br><br>
 ii) the form $\tilde\Omega=d\omega$ is non-degenerate
closed $2$-form <br><br>

iii)   The form $\omega$ is invariant with respect
to the Hamiltonian vector field of Hamiltonmian $H$:
       $$
\L_{D_H}\omega_H=0\,.
       $$
<b> Remark</b>  Note that an $1$-form  which obeys
condition ii) cannot be defined
on all the manifold $M$, since
in this case $\int_M\tilde\Omega^n=0$.
(It can be proved?)<br><br>
<b> Remark</b>   
It seems to me that  condition iii) 
in language of Schwarz means that 
Hamiltonian vector field $D_H$ is compact
  (Seee the paper Schwarz, Zaboronsky, Comm.
Mathh.Phys., 1995)<br><br>
<br><br>
Now consider the function  depending on parameter $t$:
       $$
Z(t)=\int_{\Pi T^*M} e^{iH+\Omega}
        e^{id_{D_H}\omega}\,.
     $$
We see that
       $$
Z(t)=\int_{\Pi T^*M} e^{iH+\Omega)}
e^{id_{D_H}\omega}=
 \int_{\Pi T^*M} e^{iH+\Omega)}
e^{i\tilde H+\tilde\Omega}\,,
       $$
where  $\tilde H=\omega{\cal c} D_H$
and $\tilde \Omega=d\omega$.
Thus we come to
       $$
Z(t)= C\int_M e^{iH}e^{i\tilde H}
\left(
    {\Omega^n\over n!}
          +
          t
 {\Omega^{n-1}\wedge \tilde\Omega\over (n-1)!} 
          +
t^2{\Omega^{n-2}\wedge \tilde\Omega^2\over 2(n-2)!} 
    +\dots+
t^n{\wedge \tilde\Omega^n\over n!} 
\right)
     $$
   
The crucial thing is that <br><br>
<b> Lemma</b>  $Z(t)$ defined in equation (2)
 DOES NOT DEPEMD on $t$.   This is the statement
which states in lieu of the localisation proinciple
   (1).<br><br>
Indeed due to properties of the form $\omega$
     $$
{d Z(t)\over dt}=
     $$
