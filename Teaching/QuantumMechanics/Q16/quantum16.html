            Here I put short notes on lectures on Topics in
Quantum Mechanics, which I read for colleagues and graduate students.
   I would like to tell that this is not the course of Quantum Mechanics,
and on the other hand this is not the course of mathematical 
foundations of Quantum Mechanics.  I just  try here to explain some facts
in Quantum Mechanics to mathematicians,  establishing translation
table.  Physisists usually performing  right
calculations change if necessary without any hesitations
`regles du jeu'. I would try in these lectures to come to compromis   
     

   Lectures will be on Thursdays at 12 usually in Frank Adams big room.
