 <a href="riemgeom14.pdf"> Here </a> I will put periodically 
step by step the pdf file the beginning of the draft of lecture notes.
At the end of every week (maybe sooner) I will put the lectures
which were red on Monday and on Tuesday of this week,
modifying if it is necessary
the parts of the lecture which are different from former years. 
Sure students may read former years lectures but sometimes this will
be a source of confusion. Homeworks and their solutions will appear
periodically every week: in the middle of every week the next Homework
and the solution of the former one. 

<p> All the material which is noted by \dagger, 
and which is written in small scripts is not compulsory.

The subsections which are denoted by * are for 15 credit students, 
They are not compulsory for 10 credit students.

About Appendices: they are not compulsory also except appendices
 denoted by * (subsection: Integrals of motion and geodesics)
 which are compuslory only for 15 credit students. (it will be additional
lectures related with this staff.)
 
 Students who did not learn Gaussian and mean curvature in second year
may see Appendices, or lecture notes for the course 
"Introduction to Geometry". One note: Weingarten operator is called
 sometimes `Shape operator'.
