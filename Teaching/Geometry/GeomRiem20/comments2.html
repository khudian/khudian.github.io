 <h2>        Dear Riemannian Geometry students.</h2>




 <a href="cwriem20f.pdf"> Here </a>   I will  put the
 pdf file of the coursework in a vicinity of 12 March 2020



<p>




<p>



<p>

The pdf file contains 8 pages.

The first page is title page. Please write your name here.
<p>



 Please, try to write the solutions in the spaces provided 
underneath and overleaf.
(Sure you can use additional papers and put them between 
the pages if you need.)








<p>



You are welcome to ask me any, especially mathematical question,
by e-mail or in person.

<br>



<br>
If a question is "good enough" I will answer this question 
and if it is important
I will answer to all students.
<!--How?   I will print the question and answers in my webpage
<!-- <a href="qans.html"> here </a>-->  
or send to all of you circulate letter.-->




<br>

 
<br>
Solutions have to be clear and short. I will appreciate very much if your
handwriting is readable and if you will use thick pen.


<p>

<!--You do not need to answer starred questions if you do 10 
credit version of this course.-->

how you have solved the problems.)
