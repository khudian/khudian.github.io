       Dear students,

Due to Coronavirus Pandemie we will switch on on-line teaching.

During Lecture (Monday 20 April 10 am) we will recall the
parallel transport and geodesics.   Our lecture will be founded
on lecture notes and  
  <a href="20april.pdf"> these slides</a>    


</li>

<Li>

During Lecture and Tutorial (Thursday 23 10 am--11.50 am) we will
formulate Theorem about  changing of a vector during parallel transport
along closed curve on the surface in $E^3$. Then we will exlain
what is it Weingarten (Shape) operator, and how to calculate
Gaussian curvature in terms of Shape operator.   We will end the lecture
calculating Gaussian curvature for cylinder and sphere

Our lecture will be founded on lecture notes and 
<a href="23april2.pdf"> these slides</a>

During these two hours we will find a time and I will explain how to calculate
Christoffel symbols of Levi-Civita connection using Euler-lagrange
equations of motion.

Our improvised tutorial  will be founded on homeworks  and 
<a href="23april1.pdf"> these slides</a>

During Lecture tomorrow (on Monday 27April 10 am) we will consider
again the Theorem about parallel transport of vector over closed
curve, and we consider more detailed formulation of this theorem.
  Then we deduce from this statement Gauss Theorema Egregium.

During Lecture and tutorial tomorrow (on Thursday  30 April 10-11) 
we will define curvature tensor for arbitrary connection, express it
in terms of Christoffel symbols.  The fact that curvature is expressed
via tensor implies that we can answer the question: does there exist
coordinates such that metric is Euclidean.

During Lecture tomorrow (on Monday  04 May 10-11) 
we will consider Gauss-Bonet Theorem about integral of Gaussain
curvature over surface and its relation to Euler characteristic of the surface.
