 <h2>        Dear Geometry students.</h2>




 <a href="cwgeom13.pdf"> Here </a>  I put pdf file of the coursework (on Thursday 21 March).
<p>

The pdf file contains 5 pages.

The first page is title page. Please write your name here.

<p>

There are four questions.

 Please, try to write the solutions in the spaces provided underneath and overleaf.
(Sure you can use additional papers and put them between the pages if you need.)





<p>

If any of you has problems to print the pdf file, please
do not hesitate to ask me: I will give you a copy.

<p>

You are welcome to ask me any, especially mathematical question,
by e-mail or in person.

<br>



<br>
 If a question is "good enough" I will answer this question and if it is important
I will circulate the answer to all students.
 How?   I will print the question and answers in my webpage
<a href="qans.html"> here </a> ,
 or I will send all of you the circular letter via Campus Solutions.




<br>

 The coursework contains 4 problems.
<br>
Solutions have to be clear and short. I will appreciate very much if your
handwriting will be  readable.


 <p>

You have to return the coursework with solutions provided  at the end of the first
week after Easter Holidays.
The deadline is 19-th April.   Later  I
will provide you hardcopies of the solutions of the Coursework.
