 <h2>        Dear Riemannian Geometry students.</h2>




 <a href="cwriem10.pdf"> Here </a>  is pdf file of the coursework which was distributed before Easter holidays. 



<p>


 <h2> Attention: Please note that there are errata in the question 5 
(see the corrected version on the web)</h2>


<p>

     For students who did not receive the hardcopy:

<p>

The pdf file contains 12 pages. 

The first page is title page. Please write your name here.

<p>

 The text of the questions is written on the pages 2,4,6,8 and 10.

 Please, try to write the solutions in the spaces provided underneath and overleaf.
(Please, try to "pack" your solution and do not produce additional papers.)
E,g. it will be excellent if you could write the solution of the question 1 on 
the pages 1 and 2 overleaf, e.t.c.




<p>



You are welcome to ask me any, especially mathematical question,
by e-mail or in person.

<br>



<br>
<!-- If a question is "good enough" I will answer this question and if it is important
I will circulate the answer to all students.
 How?   I will print the question and answers in my webpage
 <a href="qans.html"> here </a> .-->




<br>

 The coursework contains 5 problems.   
<br>
Solutions have to be clear and short. I will appreciate very much if your
handwriting is readable.


<p>

You do not need to answer starred questions if you do 10 credit version of this course.


 
 <p>



You have to return the coursework with solutions provided after the
first week after  Easter holiday. The deadline is 26-rd April. Then I
will provide you hardcopies of the solutions of the Coursework.
