 <h2>        Dear Geometry students.</h2>




 <a href="cwgeom12.pdf"> Here </a>  I put pdf file of the coursework.
<p>

The pdf file contains 5 pages.

The first page is title page. Please write here your name and the name
of your academic advisor (tutor).

<p>


 Please, try to write the solutions in the spaces provided underneath and overleaf.
(Sure you can use additional papers and put them between the pages if you need.)





<p>

If any of you has problems to print the pdf file, please
do not hesitate to ask me: I will give you a copy.

<p>

You are welcome to ask me any, especially mathematical question,
by e-mail or in person.

<br>



<br>
 If a question is "good enough" I will answer this question and if it is important
I will circulate the answer to all students.
 How?   I will print the question and answers in my webpage
 <a href="qans.html"> here </a> .




<br>

 The coursework contains 4 problems. Every problem contains 3 questions.
<br>
Solutions have to be clear and short. I will appreciate very much if your
handwriting will be  readable.


 <p>

You have to return the coursework with solutions provided at beginning of the first week after
Easter holidays.
The deadline is noon of 19 April.   Later  I
will provide you hardcopies of the solutions of the Coursework.
