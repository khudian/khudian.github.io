   {\bf Dear Riemannian geometry students}

  Due to temprorary vision problems I was forced to delay the putting
on the web  of lecture notes for the former weekr, and
the version which appears just now is not completed.

  I put the lecture notes with some  changings.
 In particular the new paragraph 
 ``Inversion and Stereographic projection'' is added, but  
The full version of this paragraph will appear  later.

  My apologies
