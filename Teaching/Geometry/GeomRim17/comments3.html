 <h2>        Dear Riemannian Geometry students</h2>

<p>
This year the format of the examination will 
change. This is why I put the Mock examination.



<p>

 <a href="mockrgm173.pdf"> Here </a> I have 
put pdf file of the Mock examination 
for 10 credits students.

   Examination for 15 credits students will continue
   3 hours (for 10 credit students 2 hours). 
    The sections A and section B will be the same as
for 10 credit students.  It will be also
an additional section, the section C. It will possess
two questions, and you have to answer both questions.
The section C will be 40 marks in total.
