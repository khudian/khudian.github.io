 <h2>        Dear Geometry students.</h2>




 <a href="cwgeom19web.pdf"> Here </a>  is 
the  pdf file of the coursework. 
<p>

The pdf file contains 8 pages.

The first page is title page. Please write your name here.

<p>

 Please, try to write the solutions in the spaces provided underneath 
and overleaf.
(Sure you can use additional papers and put them between the pages 
if you need.)





<p>

If any of you has problems to print the pdf file, please
do not hesitate to ask me: I will give you a copy.

<p>

You are welcome to ask me any, especially mathematical questions,
by e-mail or in person.

<br>



<br>
 If a question is "good enough" I will answer this question and 
if it is important
I will circulate the answer to all students.
 <!--How?   I will print the question and answers in my webpage
<a href="qans.html"> here </a> 
 or I will send all of you the circular letter via Campus Solutions.
-->



<br>

 The coursework contains 3 questions.
<br>
Solutions have to be clear and short. I will appreciate 
very much if your
handwriting will be readable and you will use a thick pen.


 <p>

The deadline for  returning  the coursework with solutions provided  
 Thursday 28 March  3pm.  
 
Later
I will provide you hardcopies of the 
solutions of the Coursework, and also I will put on
the Web notes about how you did this Coursework
(in these notes we will discuss 
how you have solved the problems.)
