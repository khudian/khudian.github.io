 <h2>        Dear Geometry students.</h2>




 <a href="cwgeom18web.pdf"> Here </a>  I have 
put pdf file of the coursework. 
<p>

The pdf file contains 6 pages.

The first page is title page. Please write your name here.

<p>

There are three questions.

 Please, try to write the solutions in the spaces provided underneath 
and overleaf.
(Sure you can use additional papers and put them between the pages 
if you need.)





<p>

If any of you has problems to print the pdf file, please
do not hesitate to ask me: I will give you a copy.

<p>

You are welcome to ask me any, especially mathematical questions,
by e-mail or in person.

<br>



<br>
 If a question is "good enough" I will answer this question and 
if it is important
I will circulate the answer to all students.
 <!--How?   I will print the question and answers in my webpage
<a href="qans.html"> here </a> 
 or I will send all of you the circular letter via Campus Solutions.
-->



<br>

 The coursework contains 3 questions.
<br>
Solutions have to be clear and short. I will appreciate 
very much if your
handwriting will be readable and you will use a thick pen.


 <p>

After Easter break
I will provide you hardcopies of the 
solutions of the Coursework, and also I will put on
