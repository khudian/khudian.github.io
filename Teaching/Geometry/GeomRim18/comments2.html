 <h2>        Dear Riemannian Geometry students.</h2>




 <a href="cwriem18web.pdf"> Here </a>   I have put the
 pdf file of the coursework.



<p>




<p>



<p>

The pdf file contains 8 pages.

The first page is title page. Please write your name here.

<p>

 The text of the questions is written on the pages 2,4 and 7.

 Please, try to write the solutions in the spaces provided 
underneath and overleaf.
(Sure you can use additional papers and put them between 
the pages if you need.)








<p>



You are welcome to ask me any, especially mathematical question,
by e-mail or in person.

<br>



<br>
If a question is "good enough" I will answer this question 
and if it is important
I will answer to all students.
How?   I will print the question and answers in my webpage
<!-- <a href="qans.html"> here </a>-->  
or send to all of you circulate letter.




<br>

 
<br>
Solutions have to be clear and short. I will appreciate very much if your
handwriting is readable and if you will use thick pen.


<p>

<!--You do not need to answer starred questions if you do 10 
credit version of this course.-->



 <p>



The deadline to return the coursework with solutions provided
is 18  April 3pm.
