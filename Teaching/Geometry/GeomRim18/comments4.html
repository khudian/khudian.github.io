 <h2>        Dear Riemannian Geometry students</h2>

<p>



<p>

   Here it is feedback of last two years examinations.

    This year this exam is only for 10 credits students
and it will continue 2 hours.
(Last years the exam for 15 credits students was 3 hours.)
 
 Respectively the section C in exams papers 2017,
and question 5 in exam papers for 2016 are omited.
(Last years it was for 15 credits  students)

This year it will be just two sections: section
A, where you have to answer all four questions, and
the section B  where the credit will be given for
 the best two answers.

   The question related with derivation formulae
(see question A4 in 2017) this year is not examinable.
