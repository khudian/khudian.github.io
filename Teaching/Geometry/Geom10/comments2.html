 <h2>        Dear Geometry students.</h2>




 <a href="cwgeom10.pdf"> Here </a>  I put pdf file of the coursework 

<p>

The pdf file contains 10 pages. 

The first page is title page. Please write your name here.

<p>

 The text of the questions is written on the pages 2,4,6,8 and 9.

 Please, try to write the solutions in the spaces provided underneath and overleaf.
(Please, try to "pack" your solution and do not produce additional papers.)
E,g. it will be excellent if you could write the solution of the question 1 on 
the pages 1 and 2 overleaf, e.t.c.




<p>

If any of you has problems to print the pdf file, please 
do not hesitate to ask me: I will give you a copy.

<p>

You are welcome to ask me any, especially mathematical question,
by e-mail or in person.

<br>



<br>
 If a question is "good enough" I will answer this question and if it is important
I will circulate the answer to all students.
 How?   I will print the question and answers in my webpage
 <a href="qans.html"> here </a> .




<br>

 The coursework contains 5 problems.   
<br>
Solutions have to be clear and short. I will appreciate very much if your
handwriting is readable.

 
 <p>

You have to return the coursework with solutions provided after the
first week after  Easter holiday. The deadline is 26-rd April. Then I
will provide you hardcopies of the solutions of the Coursework.
