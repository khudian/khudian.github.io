 <h2>        Dear Geometry students.</h2>




 In the solutions of problems 1 and 2 of Homework 6
   I put function g equal to  exp(-(x^2+y^2)) instead  putting it g=y^2-x^2.
    <a href="solutions61.pdf"> Here </a>
    I put pdf file of the solution of problems 1 and 2 of Homework 6
    where the function g=y^2-x^2 as it is in problems 1 and 2 of Homework 6.
