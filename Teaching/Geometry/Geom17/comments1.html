 <a href="geom17web.pdf"> Here </a> is  the pdf file
 of the  lecture notes.
These lecture notes cover the lectures
of first 7 weeks.


<br>

<p>  See below the pdf files of scanned 
lectures for last four weeks.
 This is lectures on conic 
sections and basic notions of projective geometry.

 Every `lecture' contains  4-5 pages. 
It normally
 covers material of 2/3-rd 
 of usual 50 minutes lecture
  (The content of last 12 lectures cover the
8 50 minutes lectures for last four weeks.)
  These lectures are so `small' because of
some technical reasons related with scanning of
 the files.

 <a href="geom17CI.pdf"> Here </a> it is the pdf file
of the lecture C1 of second part of the course. 
Here
we  give the geometrical definition of 
ellipse, hyperbola and parabola.
(This lecture began at 22-nd March and will 
end at 23-March)

 <a href="geom17C22.pdf"> Here </a> is
 the pdf file
of the lecture C2 of second part of 
the course. Here
we will recall Cartesian coordinates, 
and transformation
from Cartesian coordinates to another 
Cartesian coordinates.
At the end very briefly we consider general 
affine transformations of plane.
(This lecture  began and ended
at 23 march.)

 <a href="geom17CIII.pdf"> Here </a> is 
the pdf file
of the lecture C3 of second part of the course. 
Here
we give analytical definition of
conic sections---ellipse, hyperbola and parabola. 
We show that
analytical definition of conic sections is 
equivalent
to their geometrical definition, which we considered 
in the lecture C1)
(This lecture  began at 24-th March and it ended
at 29 March.)

 <a href="geom17CIV.pdf"> Here </a> it is
 the pdf file
of the lecture C4 of second part of the course. Here
we will formulate and prove the fundamental Theorem
that intersection of plane with surface of cone
is an ellipse, hyperbola or parbola
(except degenerate cases).
(This justifies the termin `conic section'
for these curves.)
<p> We consider the orthogonal 
projection of a conic section
(intersection of plane with conic surface
   $k^2x^2+k^2y^2=z^2$) 
on the horizontal plane
   $z=0$.  The orthogonal projection 
is also a conic section, and vertex of the
cone iz one of the foci of this conic section.
 <p>The very last page of this lecture is 
not compulsory.

 <a href="geom17CV.pdf"> Here </a> is
 the pdf file of the very short lecture,
the lecture C5 of second part of the course. Here
we show that affine transformations 
(not orthogonal!)
transform ellipse to circle, and 
using this fact we come to
the  formula for area of an ellipse.

 <a href="geom17CVI.pdf"> Here </a> is
 the pdf file of the 
lecture C6 of second part of the course.
 In this lecture we introduce the concept of
projective line. Projective line= Line with
  a point at infinity. It can be defined as
 a set of lines in $R^2$
  which pass through origin. 
  It is useful to consider the usual line 
$y=1$ in $R^2$. Then points of projective 
line $RP^1$
can be viewed as points of usual line 
   $y=1$ with coordinate $u$, and the point at 
infinity.
 Every point $u$ of the line $y=1$ can be viewed
as the 
intersection of the line $x=uy$ passing
through origin with the line $y=1$.
The point at infinity is represented by the line
$y=0$, which is parallel to the line $y=1$.

We introduce 
  homogeneous coordinates on projective line
  $RP^1$.
(This lecture  began and ended
at 26 April-the first lecture after Easter break.)   

<p>

Attention:  the third line of the first 
page of this lecture
is written `projected line'. This has to be written
`projective line'.

 <a href="geom17CVII.pdf"> Here </a> is
 the pdf file of the 
lecture C7 of second part of the course.
 In this lecture we 
consider projective transformations of projective
line $RP^1$.
   The transformations of Euclidean 
line which preserve
the Euclidean structure (distance)--the isometry
of Euclidean line--- are translations 
(and reflection).
    The transformations of  
  of affine line $R$ which preserve
 affine structure
are enlargements (dilations) 
  and translations.


<p>Projective transformations of projective 
line  $RP^1$ are described
  by linear transformation in $R^2$: 
to linear transformation
  $x\to x'=ax+by, y\to y'=cx+dy$
we assign transformation
   $[x:y]\to [x':y']=[ax+by:cx+dy]$
in homogeneous coordinates.
 (We suppose that linear transformation 
 is non-degenerate, i.e. $ad-bc\not=0$.)
Respectively in affine coordinate 
(u=x/y) we come to 
linear fractional transformations:
  $u'=x'/y'=(au+b)/(cu+d)$. They
include  affine trasnformation of affine line.
(This lecture  began 
at 26 April and it ended at 27 April.)

 <a href="geom17CVIII.pdf"> Here </a> is
the pdf file of the 
lecture C8 of second part of the course.
 In this lecture we
defined the  cross-ratio $(A,B,C,D)$  
of four distinct points
   $A,B,C,D$ on the porjective line.
If  $u_A$ is affine coordinate of a point $A$, 
$u_B$ is affine coordinate of a point $B$, 
$u_C$ is affine coordinate of a point $C$, 
$u_D$ is affine coordinate of a point $D$
then the cross ratio of these points is 
equal to
     $(A,B,C,D)=
{(u_A-u_C)(u_B-u_D)}
          /
{(u_A-u_D)(u_B-u_C)}
         $.
One can define also cross-ratio in 
homogeneous coordinates.
The cross-ratio is the invariant of 
projective 
transformations.  We will give the 
proof of this result
(not compulsory) and show that the central 
projection preserves the cross-ration, and it
 is the special case of projective transformations.
(One can show that every projective 
transformation is  composition
of central projections.)

at 27 April.)

 <a href="geom17CIX.pdf"> Here </a> it is 
 the pdf file of the 
lecture C9 of second part of the course.
 In this lecture we
define the projective plane $RP^2$.
Projective plane $RP^2$ is the set of lines
in $R^3$ passing through origin.
Projective plane  may be viewed
as a set which possesses the usual 
affine plane $R^2$
and set of points at infinity.
  Indeed consider the usual plane $z=1$ in $R^3$.
Then every point $(u,v)$ of this plane
can be viewed as the intersection of the line
$x=uz,y=vz$ passing through origin with this plane.
The lines passing through origin which are parallel 
to the plane $z=1$ represent points at infinity.
(We can think on $RP^2$ as union of plane
  $R^2$ and the projective line $RP^1$.)
(Compare with definition of 
projective line.) 
(This lecture  was on 3-rd May).

 <a href="geom17CX.pdf"> Here </a> is
 the pdf file of the 
lecture C10  of second part of the course.
  In this lecture we consider 
projective lines on projective planes.
Recall that a point of $RP^2$=
line in $R^3 passing through origin.
Projective line in $RP^2$=set of lines
which belong to the same plane, i.e.
projective line is represented by plane in 
$R^3$ passing through origin. 
If $A=[x_A:y_A:z_A]$, 
 $B=[x_B:y_B:z_B]$ are two point on $RP^2$
the the line $AB$ passing thorug these points is
represented by the plane
   $mr_A+nr_B$ spanned by the
vectors $r_A=(x_A,y_A,z_A)$ 
and $r_B=(x_B,y_B,z_B)$.
 
<p> Then  we consider 
the conception of collinearity
for points: three points $A,B,C$ in the 
projective plane
are collinear if they belong to the same 
projective line. We formulate the 
criterion that three
points are collinear in terms of 
homogeneous coordinates
and in terms of affine coordinates.

(This lecture   
began and finished  at 3-rd May)

 <a href="geom17CXI.pdf"> Here </a> it
is  the pdf file of the 
lecture C11  of second part of the course.
  In this lecture we calculate
cross-ratio 
of four distinct points
  $A,B,C,D$ which are collinear, i.e. which belong
to the same projective plane.
   Considering an arbitrary affine coordinate
of these points (the same coordinate for all
points !)
we calculate the cross-ratio of these points.
  The answer does not depend on the choice of
how we have chosen an affine coordinate, since
cross-ratio is the invariant of projective
transformations which include the affine
transformations.
 


<p> How to calculate the cross-ratio if one of the
points is at infinity. Sure we may use homogeneous
coordinates, or to do it considering the point
moving to infinity (see also the exercise 3 from tthe Homework 8). This part of the
lecture and the rest of the
lecture is not compulsory

<p> At the end of the lecture
we consider  the projective
transformation of projective plane $RP^2$.

Recalling  projective transformations of
projective line $RP^1$ (see the lecture C7)
we define projective transformation
  by linear transformation in $R^3$: 
in  the following way: to linear transformation
  $x\to x'=ax+by+cz$, 
  $y\to y'=dx+ey+fz$
  $z\to z'=gx+hy+iz$
we assign transformation
in homogeneous coordinates by
   $[x:y:z]\to [x':y':z']=
   [ax+by+cz:dx+ey+fz:gx+hy+iz]$
(we suppose that corresponding linear 
transformation is non-degenerate).
Respectively in affine coordinate 
(u=x/z, v=y/z) we come to 
linear fractional transformations:
  $u'=x'/z'=(au+bv+c)/(gu+hv+i)$. 
  $v'=y'/z'=(du+ev+f)/(gu+hv+i)$. 
These transformations 
include  affine transformation of affine plane:
  $u'=au+bv+e, v'=cu+dv+f$.
<br>

<p>

 <a href="geom17CXII.pdf"> Here </a> is  
the pdf file of the last 
lecture, the lecture  C12 of the 
second part of the course.
 In this lecture we return to classification of 
conic sections on
the base of the projective geometry.
First of all we note again that ellipse and circle
are affine equivalent (see also the lecture C5)
 Then we consider the following example:

 <pt> Consider the curve $C$, locus of points
  $x^2+2kxy+y^2+x+y=1$. Performing linear
transformations  $x=u+v,y=u-v$ we come in new affine
coordinates to the curve
  $2(1+k)u^2+2(1-k)v^2+u=1$.
 We see that
for $k=1$ our curve is just set 
of two parallel lines: $4u^2+u=1$.
For $k=-1$ it is a parabola $4v^2+u=1$, 
for $-1<k<1$
it is an ellipse, and for other values of
$k$ it is hyperbola.
One can easy see that performing arbitrary affine
transofrmations (which are not necessarily preserving
the length) we cam transform every ellipse
to unit circle $u^2+v^2=1$ , one can transform
every hyperbola to the hyperbola $u^2-v^2=1$,
and every parabola to the parabola $u^2=v$.
What happens if we allow not only arbitrary affine
transfomrations but also prokjective transformations
of projective plane. We consider just two examples, where
 projective transformation transforms ellipse to
hyperbola, and circle to the parabola.
   In the realm of projective geometry 
all (non-degenerate) 
conic sections are on an equal footing. 
 (The part of this lecture related
with projective equivalence of conic 
sections is not compulsory.)
