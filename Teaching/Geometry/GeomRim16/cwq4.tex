 \centerline   {\bf   Dear Riemannian Geometry students!}

  I would like to clarify that 
  In the question 1c) where you have to calculate the length of the line
  $y=ax$
the equation of the line has to be written  
   $v=au$, where $u,v$ are Cartesian coordinates in the plane ${\bf R}^2$
and $a$ is a constant.  I just put the correction in the file.

   Many thanks to Alice Roseberry- Haynes, 
 Her question initiated this remark,
  and sure sorry if this was the sourse of confusion. 

     Best

            HMK


\bye
